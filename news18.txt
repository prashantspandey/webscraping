Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Blow-by-blow Account of How India Trumped Pakistan at World Court
New Delhi:  With the International Court of Justice staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav until the final verdict, India has emphatically won the first and the most important round of its legal battle against Pakistan at the global arena.
This, without a shred of doubt, is the most important reprieve at the moment since stalling Jadhav's execution was an imminent need. Without a stay on the execution, the entire purpose of invoking ICJ's jurisdiction would have been frustrated and the exercise would have been rendered an academic one to examine issues of jurisdiction, conventions etc.
Here are the five reasons outlined by News18 earlier in the day, predicting a propitious outcome, and how the ICJ ruled on these points:
Reason 1: India has been very meticulous and succinct in asking for a limited relief. What it prays for now is a stay on Jadhav's execution. If the stay is granted, not just that main relief will have to be adjudicated, but India will get time to look for a diplomatic and political solution.
ICJ ruling: India's claim for the limited relief at this juncture is justified on the principles of international law. The execution has to be stayed until we finally decide the matter on aspects of jurisdiction and applicability of Vienna Convention.
News18 was the first to tell you exactly why the balance was tilted in India’s favour in this battle.
Reason 2: India's counsel Harish Salve has aptly pre-empted Pakistan’s argument on the 2008 bilateral treaty between the two countries. While Pakistan contends India cannot be allowed to invoke Vienna Convention in the wake of the bilateral treaty, Salve has maintained that bilateral treaty cannot affect India's right to protect its citizens under the Vienna Convention. Salve was unequivocal that bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan is supposed to supplant other conventions in line with their common objectives and can’t frustrate the goals.
ICJ ruling: The 2008 treaty per se doesn't oust our jurisdiction nor was it a specific bar on India's right to ask for consular access from another country under the Vienna Convention.
Reason 3: Pakistan's argument that consular access is a matter of discretion for a law enforcement agency when the foreign national has been accused of spying has also been met by India. India has questioned various facts of the case, including how Jadhav was abducted from Iran, why India's repeated requests for consular access were shot down by Pakistan, trial was conducted without informing Jadhav and without supplying copy of the chargesheet or even the judgment. The moot point that India has appealed: Graver the charges, greater the need for continued adherence to the Vienna Convention, for it would involve life of people and relations between States.
ICJ ruling: India has been seeking consular access for Jadhav for almost a year, but to no avail. Pakistan said it would consider India's request only after Indian authorities help them in providing evidence to hold Jadhav guilty of espionage.
Reason 4: Pakistan has complained India is unwilling to explain the false passport, which bore a Muslim name and was found in Jadhav's possession. But if Pakistan wants India to explain this, then why not grant the consular access thereby accepting India's role in the adjudication process. Pakistan may just fall in a trap of its own, should the ICJ accept this argument.
ICJ ruling: Indian High Commission has time and again accepted Jadhav as an Indian national and has also given documents to the Pakistani counterpart in corroboration.
Reason 5: Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav’s legal remedies have not exhausted and hence there is no "urgency" to seek "Provisional Measures". But India has successfully demonstrated there is no stay on Jadhav’s execution and he could be executed any moment, necessitating the urgent intervention.
ICJ ruling: India has successfully established links between 'provisional measures' and India's rights to claim so. India has rightly invoked urgency clause and that irreparable prejudice to India's rights will be caused if Jadhav is executed.
International law is as good a law as countries consider it to be. It is, after all, a law without direct sanctions and Pakistan may even choose to defy the order since it's in favour of India. But it will do so at the peril of its international stature, obligation and future remedies that it may seek for its citizens.
Although Pakistan had told the ICJ that Jadhav's execution won't happen before August 2017, the ICJ did not only issue a specific order staying the execution till the proceedings before it are over, but also reminded Pakistan that it must be restrained in accordance with international obligations and global commitments to ensure free and fair justice to all.

ICJ ruling: The 2008 treaty per se doesn't oust our jurisdiction nor was it a specific bar on India's right to ask for consular access from another country under the Vienna Convention.
Reason 3: Pakistan's argument that consular access is a matter of discretion for a law enforcement agency when the foreign national has been accused of spying has also been met by India. India has questioned various facts of the case, including how Jadhav was abducted from Iran, why India's repeated requests for consular access were shot down by Pakistan, trial was conducted without informing Jadhav and without supplying copy of the chargesheet or even the judgment. The moot point that India has appealed: Graver the charges, greater the need for continued adherence to the Vienna Convention, for it would involve life of people and relations between States.
ICJ ruling: India has been seeking consular access for Jadhav for almost a year, but to no avail. Pakistan said it would consider India's request only after Indian authorities help them in providing evidence to hold Jadhav guilty of espionage.
Reason 4: Pakistan has complained India is unwilling to explain the false passport, which bore a Muslim name and was found in Jadhav's possession. But if Pakistan wants India to explain this, then why not grant the consular access thereby accepting India's role in the adjudication process. Pakistan may just fall in a trap of its own, should the ICJ accept this argument.
ICJ ruling: Indian High Commission has time and again accepted Jadhav as an Indian national and has also given documents to the Pakistani counterpart in corroboration.
Reason 5: Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav’s legal remedies have not exhausted and hence there is no "urgency" to seek "Provisional Measures". But India has successfully demonstrated there is no stay on Jadhav’s execution and he could be executed any moment, necessitating the urgent intervention.
ICJ ruling: India has successfully established links between 'provisional measures' and India's rights to claim so. India has rightly invoked urgency clause and that irreparable prejudice to India's rights will be caused if Jadhav is executed.
International law is as good a law as countries consider it to be. It is, after all, a law without direct sanctions and Pakistan may even choose to defy the order since it's in favour of India. But it will do so at the peril of its international stature, obligation and future remedies that it may seek for its citizens.
Although Pakistan had told the ICJ that Jadhav's execution won't happen before August 2017, the ICJ did not only issue a specific order staying the execution till the proceedings before it are over, but also reminded Pakistan that it must be restrained in accordance with international obligations and global commitments to ensure free and fair justice to all.

New Delhi:  With the International Court of Justice staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav until the final verdict, India has emphatically won the first and the most important round of its legal battle against Pakistan at the global arena.
This, without a shred of doubt, is the most important reprieve at the moment since stalling Jadhav's execution was an imminent need. Without a stay on the execution, the entire purpose of invoking ICJ's jurisdiction would have been frustrated and the exercise would have been rendered an academic one to examine issues of jurisdiction, conventions etc.
Here are the five reasons outlined by News18 earlier in the day, predicting a propitious outcome, and how the ICJ ruled on these points:
Reason 1: India has been very meticulous and succinct in asking for a limited relief. What it prays for now is a stay on Jadhav's execution. If the stay is granted, not just that main relief will have to be adjudicated, but India will get time to look for a diplomatic and political solution.
ICJ ruling: India's claim for the limited relief at this juncture is justified on the principles of international law. The execution has to be stayed until we finally decide the matter on aspects of jurisdiction and applicability of Vienna Convention.
News18 was the first to tell you exactly why the balance was tilted in India’s favour in this battle.
Reason 2: India's counsel Harish Salve has aptly pre-empted Pakistan’s argument on the 2008 bilateral treaty between the two countries. While Pakistan contends India cannot be allowed to invoke Vienna Convention in the wake of the bilateral treaty, Salve has maintained that bilateral treaty cannot affect India's right to protect its citizens under the Vienna Convention. Salve was unequivocal that bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan is supposed to supplant other conventions in line with their common objectives and can’t frustrate the goals.

Woman Donates Womb to Daughter in India's 1st Uterus Transplant
Pune: A team of doctors in the city on Thursday successfully performed India's first womb (uterus) transplant on a 21-year-old woman.
The woman, who was born without a uterus was fitted her mother's uterus so that she can conceive normally, reported PTI.
A team of 12 doctors, headed by Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, performed the surgery which started at 12 noon on Thursday and ended at 9.15 pm at Galaxy Care Laparoscopy Institute in the city.
"The patient was born without a uterus and she wanted to have her own baby and was not ready for adoption or surrogacy. Since they knew about the uterus transplant, they approached us and accepted the surgery option," Dr Shailesh Puntambekar said.
"Fortunately, her mother was found to be a medically suitable uterus donor for her," he added.
The younger woman is now under observation and will be kept in Intensive Care Unit for some days.
Dr Puntambekar said this was the first uterus or womb transplant in India.
The first successful uterine transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013. Twenty-five such surgeries have been performed around the world so far.

Introduction of Electoral Bonds a Retrograde Step, EC Tells Parliament Panel
New Delhi: The Election Commission on Friday told a Parliamentary Committee that electoral bonds introduced by the government is a "retrograde" step as it would compromise transparency in political funding.
The Commission, in a written submission to the parliamentary standing committee on Law and Personnel, said changes made in the election laws after the introduction of the bonds would compromise transparency in political fundings.
"The amendment in section 29 C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 making it no longer necessary to report details of donations received through electoral bonds is a retrograde step as transparency of political funding would be compromised as a result of the change," it said.
Senior Commission officials, including Deputy Election Commissioners Umesh Sinha and Vijay Dev, had appeared before the committee today to speak on EVMs, paper trail machines and electoral reforms.

Day After ICJ Stayed Jadhav's Execution, Pakistan Seeks Re-hearing: Reports
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav’s execution, Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the ICJ seeking a re-hearing in the case, Dunya News reported.
On Thursday, India scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ asking Pakistan to take “all measures” to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
Reading out the verdict, the ICJ court dismissed Pakistan's reservations and held that it had jurisdiction in the case because of Vienna Convention."Prima facie, a dispute exists under the Vienna Convention," held the court.
The court said it considered that Pakistan's failure to provide consular access to India was under the scope of Vienna Convention.
"Acts alleged by India fall in the Vienna Convention, which guarantees the state to be given access to its citizen," said the ICJ verdict.
In another blow to Pakistan, the court said that the circumstances in which Jadhav was arrested remained "disputed".

New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav’s execution, Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the ICJ seeking a re-hearing in the case, Dunya News reported.
On Thursday, India scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ asking Pakistan to take “all measures” to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
Reading out the verdict, the ICJ court dismissed Pakistan's reservations and held that it had jurisdiction in the case because of Vienna Convention."Prima facie, a dispute exists under the Vienna Convention," held the court.
The court said it considered that Pakistan's failure to provide consular access to India was under the scope of Vienna Convention.

Kerala Assembly Passes Resolution Against GM Mustard
New Delhi: A resolution was passed in the Kerala Assembly on Friday demanding that the Centre withdraw permission for production and cultivation of Genetically Modified Mustard.
GM crops would be cultivated in the country if it was also approved by the Environment Ministry and 'it is a very serious issue', he was quoted as saying by PTI.
He demanded that the Centre not implement GEAC's decision as GM seeds would adversely affect farmers and the agriculture sector.
It would destroy traditional seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for their cultivation.
He said most states are also against GM crops.
Kumar said it has not yet been proved if GM crops would result in more yields, and claimed that it has been found that GM seeds attracts new insects.
Powerful pesticides would have to be used to safeguard crops from attacks of these insects, which in turn would harm human health, he pointed out.
GM trials were progressing in 75 varieties of crops and their target was to get approval for all crops one by one after getting sanction for GM mustard, he alleged.
"This move is dangerous to the country, farmers and also the agriculture sector", he said adding GM crops are against the interest of the people.
Congress led UDF Opposition leader supported the resolution and wanted a detailed discussion on the matter, to which the Minister said government would hold a debate in due course.

Inter-State High-Tech Sex Racket Busted in Bhopal, BJP Leader Arrested
Bhopal: The cyber cell of the Madhya Pradesh police have busted a sex racket and arrested nine people including a Bharatiya Janata Party office bearer here on Friday.
The police detected the racket in a flat in the posh Arera Colony of the city and freed four girls from Maharashtra and Meghalaya.
It came to light after the cyber unit of the state police received a complaint regarding a sex racket being run in Bhopal through a portal.
As the cyber cell probed into the complaint it was revealed that the portal supplied women through online booking. To avoid the police, the racket was being run from a flat in E-7 area in super posh Arera Colony.
Neeraj Shakya, who was recently appointed as SC Cell in BJP was also arrested by police in the case. Hours after the arrest, party state head Nandkumar Singh Chauhan expelled Shakya from the party.
Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, an officer from cyber cell said that the accused scanned various websites for finding CVs of women who were in need of job. Later, they would invite them to Bhopal on pretext of offering jobs such as beautician, receptionist and so on but then would force them to join flesh trade. The group was operating for the last three months.
The website is registered in New Delhi and has connection to other states as well. The police are now looking for the kingpin Subhash alias Veer Dwivedi who is absconding after the raid at his flat.

A two-judge bench led by Justice A M Khanwilkar said that the court would not want to deal with the issue in piecemeal and would examine all applications against Aadhaar on June 27.
“It is appropriate if we hear all interlocutory applications together…they may involve same or similar issues,” said the bench while deferring the hearing of a plea made in a PIL filed by Shantha Sinha. Sinha is former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
Rohatgi, on his part, also made it clear that the government was not going to extend the deadline of June 30 by which various schemes such as grant of scholarships, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and various other social welfare schemes were to seek mandatory Aadhaar number.
“Today, we have 120 crore people who have Aadhaar cards but they are not here. The people who are supposed to be benefited by these schemes are not before the court but those who are not going to be affected by all, keep filing petitions after petitions,” rued the AG.
He complained that there was a similar PIL filed last year with same prayers but the apex court did not grant any interim relief. “Can they go on filing petitions after petitions which have even the same text? I can show that paragraphs in this petition are true copies of what was there in the last petition on the subject. This is abuse of the process of the court,” added Rohatgi, citing a petition moved by Lt Col (retd) S G Vombatkere in October 2016.
Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Sinha, replied that the previous petition might have similar prayers but the subject matter of the present PIL was entirely different. “These notifications were not issued when the previous petition was filed. We have come with fresh cause of actions. Besides, technicality should the last thing to be argued by the AG when we are claiming violation of fundamental rights. The court had in 2015 asked the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory and they are now in breach. The AG should not shy away from replying on merit,” said Divan.
“I am not shying away…I have fought these cases 20 times,” retorted Rohatgi, adding that Aadhaar was merely an executive scheme when the restraint orders were passed but now the Parliament has passed a law. “There cannot be any injunction against the Parliament from passing a law,” said the AG, adding that only a Constitution Bench should hear the matter.
The bench also reacted: “Mr Divan! Please don’t say that this court is not available for common citizens. This court is always available for them.” It then adjourned the matter to June 27, saying the court registry, after suitable instructions from the Chief Justice of India, will place this case before an appropriate bench.
Another bench in the top court had recently reserved its verdict on yet another challenge to linking Aadhaar with PAN cards and for filing Income-Tax returns. Newly inserted provisions in the Finance Act make it mandatory for people to have Aadhaar for validating their PAN cards and for I-T returns. The deadline to link Aadhaar for this purpose is June 30.

Martyr's Family on Indefinite Fast, Wants UP CM to Visit Village
Sambhal (UP): Family members of Sepoy Sudhesh Kumar, who was killed in firing by Pakistani troops along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir last year, today sat on an indefinite fast, demanding the chief minister Yogi Adityanath's visit to Pansukha Milak village.
Villagers and family members of Kumar, who laid down his life on October 16, 2016, sat on a fast in the village, claiming that despite promises by the BJP leaders, none of them visited the family again.
"We were promised sanction for a petrol pump, construction of a road and memorial in the village and renaming a village primary school in Sudesh's name by the BJP leaders, but none of the promises was met," Sudesh's brother Manoj Kumar said.
Another brother of the martyr, Anil Kumar, said they had lost trust in local BJP leaders and that was why they were demanding that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should visit them.
Sudesh's wife Kavita, mother Santosh Kumari, father Brahmpal Singh, Anil and a number of villagers began their indefinite fast.
The family had earlier too refused to perform the last rites till the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav visited them.
Brahmpal claimed, "The then chief minister had gone to a martyr's house in Etah as he was a Yadav. He should have come here too as there should not be any discrimination between martyrs."
Sudesh, hailing from Sambhal district, was killed whenPakistani Army fired on Indian Army posts along the Line of Control in Rajouri district.
As Akhilesh did not visit martyr's family, BJP leaders during assembly polls made it a political issue. BJP vice president Shiv Pratap Shukla, state general secretary Ashok Kataria and local MP Satpal Saini had also visited them and assured all help.

180 Dalit Families 'Convert' to Buddhism after Arrests of Bhim Army Activists

Lucknow: Around 180 families from Rupdi, Egri and Kapurpur villages of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh reportedly converted to Buddhism by immersing Hindu idols into a nearby canal.
“The police is intentionally harassing us. Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad is being targeted because he raised his voice against the atrocities inflicted by upper caste people on Dalits,” said Deepak, a resident of Kapurpur village.
So far, 10 FIRs have been registered against administrators of Facebook and WhatsApp accounts which were spreading rumours and inciting communal hatred in Saharanpur. The administrators named in the FIR mostly belong to the Bhim Army. Besides 10 cases registered under IT Act, Saharanpur police have lodged 14 other FIRs and have arrested 36 persons. In the past one week, 25 houses have been burnt down, 23 vehicles have been torched and several buses have been damaged.
An unregistered group and a movement as they call it, Bhim Army started as a social media phenomenon more than two years ago. In a short span of time, thousands of Dalits across the country started identifying themselves with this ‘aggressive’ and new kind of Ambedkarite politics. There are more than 40,000 Dalits who are members of this organization and it is spreading its wings outside Uttar Pradesh also.

The immersion, families said, was symbolic of them giving up Hinduism and embracing Buddhism to express their discontent over the ‘unfair’ treatment meted out to the Bhim Army, which they think ‘is a conspiracy to defame the group of Dalit activists’ (Photo: Network18)

So far, 10 FIRs have been registered against administrators of Facebook and WhatsApp accounts which were spreading rumours and inciting communal hatred in Saharanpur. The administrators named in the FIR mostly belong to the Bhim Army. Besides 10 cases registered under IT Act, Saharanpur police have lodged 14 other FIRs and have arrested 36 persons. In the past one week, 25 houses have been burnt down, 23 vehicles have been torched and several buses have been damaged.
An unregistered group and a movement as they call it, Bhim Army started as a social media phenomenon more than two years ago. In a short span of time, thousands of Dalits across the country started identifying themselves with this ‘aggressive’ and new kind of Ambedkarite politics. There are more than 40,000 Dalits who are members of this organization and it is spreading its wings outside Uttar Pradesh also.

The immersion, families said, was symbolic of them giving up Hinduism and embracing Buddhism to express their discontent over the ‘unfair’ treatment meted out to the Bhim Army, which they think ‘is a conspiracy to defame the group of Dalit activists’ (Photo: Network18)

Man's Suicide Bid Leads to Goa Bridge Collapse; Crocodiles Slow Down Rescue
Panaji: Search operations resumed on Friday at the site of a bridge collapse in south Goa with the Navy saying efforts were slowed down after locals spotted crocodiles in the Sanvordem river.
The dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem, a tributary of river Zuari, had been closed for traffic for the last four years. It collapsed on Thursday afternoon, unable to bear the weight of scores of onlookers watching a man trying to commit suicide. Fire and emergency services were at the spot, trying to save the suicidal man when the bridge collapsed.
Two persons had drowned while around 20 swam to safety. At least 14 people were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals.
"Crocodiles are seen by locals. Separate patrolling and lookout for crocodiles instituted. Chetak helicopters in search and rescue role... to search downstream. Terrain hilly and clouded," a Navy spokesperson said.
"As per local inputs, there may be two more persons missing. A helicopter sortie is being undertaken along the river for an aerial search," he said.
"The rescue operation began at 7.30 am today and efforts are on to check whether there are any more bodies in the water," Superintendent of Police (South) Shekhar Prabhudesai told PTI.
"The search operation was called off around midnight yesterday due to poor visibility. The divers from Indian Navy and a private agency which mans Goa's beaches have been pressed into service to search for the bodies," the SP said.

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Kejriwal Opposed Note Ban as it Threatened Money Laundering: Kapil Mishra
New Delhi: Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Friday claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had opposed the demonetisation move as it threatened to "derail" his "money laundering" attempts.
Mishra told a press conference that the AAP had got money funnelled through shell companies and wondered how it accepted donations from companies that were slapped notices "for not paying VAT".
"Why did he (Kejriwal) fiercely oppose demonetisation? Why did he travel across the country against the move? Because his men, who hoard black money, were being raided by enforcement agencies," he claimed.
Kapil, who has been suspended from the AAP, also alleged that Delhi-based businessman Mukesh Kumar, who claimed to have donated Rs 2 crore to AAP in 2014, was merely a mask for "proclaimed black money offenders".
"Ten days before AAP took office in 2013, Mukesh Kumar's company was slapped a notice by the Delhi government for not paying VAT. And then this person goes on to donate Rs 2 crore to AAP," he said.
He also questioned Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for not acting against Mukesh for defaulting on VAT after coming to power in 2013.
Kejrwal's first stint as Delhi CM ended within 49 days after he quit over the Congress and BJP allegedly blocking the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill.

'Our Lawyers Were Inexperienced', 'Our Case Weak': Pak Newspapers on ICJ Verdict
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) asked Pakistan to hold off executing Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Pakistani commentators were critical of the lawyers and their legal strategy in representing the country’s case at the World Court. Here is a roundup of opinion from the top Pakistani newspapers.
‘Our Lawyers were inexperienced’Former Attorney General Irfan Qadir told Dawn News that he was shocked by the decision. “The lawyers handling these matters had no experience. The arguments had no weight. They should have been presented in a rational manner,” he said. “We need a dedicated team for Pakistan, loyal to the country. Pakistan’s jurisprudence has been ruined because of this,” he said, adding that the country needed to be better prepared with an experienced legal team.
‘Our case was inherently weak despite our counsel’s brave attempts’Lahore-based lawyer and author Yasser Latif Hamdani wrote in The Daily Times that Pakistan’s case rested on the question of whether or not the ICJ had jurisdiction, which, in turn, was based on the proposition that the India-Pakistan bilateral agreement on consular access trumps the Vienna convention. “A bilateral treaty cannot override or curtail a multilateral international convention to which a state is party,” Hamdani writes.

However, one silver lining for Pakistan is India’s decision to invoke the jurisdiction of a multilateral body. “It ends the policy of bilateralism that has been the cornerstone of India’s Pakistan policy,” Hamdani writes.
‘Nawaz Sharif should explain the outcome of the ICJ proceedings’Pakistan-tehreek-e-insaaf leader Shafqat Mehmood demanded, in The News International that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should come clean on the ICJ proceedings.
The paper quoted him as asking why the government selected a lawyer, who didn’t have a single international law case reported from the UK Supreme Court and what was the reason to engage London Queen’s Counsel who was based in Qatar? He further pressed the PM to explain why his government assigned the task to a lawyer who has never argued a case independently before the ICJ and what compelled his government to send a first year associate from Attorney General’s Office instead of AG himself to the ICJ.

The arguments had no weight. They should have been presented in a rational manner,” he said. “We need a dedicated team for Pakistan, loyal to the country. Pakistan’s jurisprudence has been ruined because of this,” he said, adding that the country needed to be better prepared with an experienced legal team.
‘Our case was inherently weak despite our counsel’s brave attempts’Lahore-based lawyer and author Yasser Latif Hamdani wrote in The Daily Times that Pakistan’s case rested on the question of whether or not the ICJ had jurisdiction, which, in turn, was based on the proposition that the India-Pakistan bilateral agreement on consular access trumps the Vienna convention. “A bilateral treaty cannot override or curtail a multilateral international convention to which a state is party,” Hamdani writes.

However, one silver lining for Pakistan is India’s decision to invoke the jurisdiction of a multilateral body. “It ends the policy of bilateralism that has been the cornerstone of India’s Pakistan policy,” Hamdani writes.
‘Nawaz Sharif should explain the outcome of the ICJ proceedings’Pakistan-tehreek-e-insaaf leader Shafqat Mehmood demanded, in The News International that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should come clean on the ICJ proceedings.
The paper quoted him as asking why the government selected a lawyer, who didn’t have a single international law case reported from the UK Supreme Court and what was the reason to engage London Queen’s Counsel who was based in Qatar? He further pressed the PM to explain why his government assigned the task to a lawyer who has never argued a case independently before the ICJ and what compelled his government to send a first year associate from Attorney General’s Office instead of AG himself to the ICJ.

New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) asked Pakistan to hold off executing Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Pakistani commentators were critical of the lawyers and their legal strategy in representing the country’s case at the World Court. Here is a roundup of opinion from the top Pakistani newspapers.

SP Government Spent Rs 15 Crore to Give Rs 20 Crore Unemployment Dole: CAG
Lucknow: The erstwhile SP government led by Akhilesh Yadav spent over Rs 15 crore on programmes to distribute unemployment doles worth over Rs 20 crore, according to a report by the country's top audit body.
The latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that this took place despite the flagship unemployment allowance scheme having specific guidelines that the money should be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The account details had to be provided by beneficiaries on their application forms for availing the scheme.
In its 235-page report on the general and social sector tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, now in session, the CAG pointed out that the expenditure could have been avoided if functions were not held to distribute the dole.
It stated that the state government launched the scheme in May 2012, saying that quarterly payment was to be made in the savings accounts of beneficiaries, either in a nationalised banks or in Kshetriya Gramin Bank.
Records of the director, training and employment, UP, revealed that the department distributed Rs 20.58 crore to 1,26,521 unemployed people as allowance by organising functions in 69 districts during the year 2012-13.
The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.

NGT Bans Open Defecation, Waste Dumping on Yamuna Floodplains
New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of Rs 5,000 for those who violated the diktat.
A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also constituted a committee headed by Delhi Jal Board CEO to oversee the execution of work pertaining to cleaning of the river and asked it to submit reports at regular intervals.
The Delhi government and the municipal corporations were directed to immediately take action against industries which operate in residential areas and are a major source of pollution to the river.
The green panel noted that almost 67 per cent of the pollution reaching the Yamuna would be treated by the two sewage treatment plants (STP) located at Delhi Gate and Najafgarh under Phase 1 of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.
The apex green panel had on May 1 ordered inspection of the STPs at Delhi Gate and Okhla with a view to ensure that wastewater was cleaned before it reached the Yamuna. It had sought a report with regard to functioning of these plants.
The tribunal was informed that a total of 14 STP projects are to be constructed to clean wastewater. Of these, seven are to be built by the Delhi Jal Board with its own funds.
The directions came as the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.

The bench had reserved the order on his bail plea after hearing arguments of both the prosecution and defence on May 8.
Bandyopadhyay had been arrested on January 3 by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the Rs 17,000 crore Rose Valley Chit fund case, which is being probed by the agency under the Supreme Court's directions.
Besides pleading that the senior politician from West Bengal was not involved in the scam, his counsel said that Bandyopadhyay was seriously ill and, therefore, needed to be granted bail.
The CBI has arrested another TMC MP, Tapas Pal, for his alleged involvement in the scam. The agency had earlier accused Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu and three others of defrauding investors from across the country of more than Rs 17,000 crore.

Class 12 CBSE Results: Students Anxious, But Hopeful of Low DU Cut-offs
New Delhi: While there has been no official declaration from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the Class 12 board results are expected to be declared this week. Like every year, students, this year too, are anxious about the fruits of their hard work, and what lies ahead. The only silver lining in between this panic and anxiety is the scrapping of the moderation policy.
"I’m sure everyone is anxious about the results, but with the CBSE scrapping the moderation policy, we’re at least sure that the university cutoffs will be realistic. Candidates, hopefully, will get a fair deal this time,” said Aayushi Bhardwaj, a student at Raja Ram Mohan Roy Public School who sat for the Class 12 boards.
Doing away with disparity in marking system of various education boards, Union Human Resources Development Ministry, last month, asked the boards to scrap the marks moderation policy, under which extra marks were awarded to students in certain papers that were considered to be difficult. This, in turn, is expected to bring down the high cut-offs for admission at prestigious colleges and universities.
In a meeting called by the HRD ministry, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), Indian School Certificate (ISC), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) and state boards unanimously agreed to do away with the marks moderation policy.
The move comes after CBSE, last year, had requested the HRD ministry to create consensus on phasing out of marks moderation policy, which inadvertently led to a spike in marks obtained by students of certain boards.
CBSE chairman R K Chaturvedi has reportedly asked Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to award “appropriate weightage” to CBSE students for admission to undergraduate program this year “so that they do not lose out to candidates from other state boards that inflate their Class XII results.”

Window Closes Today But Pak Refuses to Reveal If Jadhav Has Filed an Appeal
New Delhi: The 40-day period for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence handed to him by a Pakistani military court ends on Friday.
If the appellate court rejects the appeal, Jadhav can lodge a mercy petition (with the army chief) within 60 days of the decision, that is by July 18. If the mercy petition is denied on July 19, he may lodge a mercy petition with the President of Pakistan within 90 days — by October 16.
Also Read: Long Road To Justice: Timeline Of Kulbhushan Jadhav Saga
Jadhav’s case received a boost on Thursday when the ICJ sided with India and ordered Pakistan to stay the execution till proceedings were pending with the world court. It also upheld India’s right to consular access, a request Pakistan has denied as many as 16 times.
Also Read: Premature for India to Celebrate ICJ Order, Says Sarabjit Singh's Pakistani Lawyer
Pakistan, which announced the sentence on Jadhav on April 10, claims its security forces arrested him from its restive Balochistan province on March 3 last year after he reportedly entered from Iran. However, India maintains that he was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.
Jadhav's case is the latest flash-point in the tensions between Pakistan and India. The two countries last faced off at the ICJ 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.

Premature for India to Celebrate ICJ Order: Sarabjit Singh's Pakistani Lawyer
Eram Agha |  News18.com
 @erampatrakar
New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.
Also Read | Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: India Had 4 Concerns. Here's How ICJ Responded
What does this case mean for the already strained India-Pak relations?
Kubhushan’s case has a direct bearing on India-Pakistan relations. The excellent and very timely move by India to go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has attracted the attention of the whole world. The world has come to know the sensitivity and importance of this case. Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.

What does this case mean for the already strained India-Pak relations?
Kubhushan’s case has a direct bearing on India-Pakistan relations. The excellent and very timely move by India to go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has attracted the attention of the whole world. The world has come to know the sensitivity and importance of this case. Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Pak Files Plea For Re-hearing at ICJ
Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking a re-hearing in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. India had scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ staying the execution of former Indian Navy officer Jadhav. The UN's highest judicial body also asked Pakistan to take "all measures" to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
India has hailed the verdict while Pakistan remains in denial over the ICJ’s jurisdiction.

RECAP | The Foreign Office spokesperson of Pakistan has reacted to the ICJ's order, staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav. "India has been trying to hide its real face" by taking the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav to ICJ. Pakistan will present solid evidence against Jadhav in the International Court,” the spokesperson said. The Pakistan foreign office also said that the International Court of Justice had no jurisdiction over the matters of national security. "India desperately tried to divert the world attention by portraying the entire case through a humanitarian angle," the statement said.

RECAP | Reacting to the stay on execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the International Court of Justice order was a serious indictment of the Pakistan's judicial system. Dalbir Kaur, the sister of Sarabjit Singh, who died in a Pakistan jail in 2013, hailed the verdict, terming it as a victory of crores of Indians.
RECAP | “As a lawyer for 40 years, you get a feel of how judges are reacting. I felt a positive energy when I was arguing the case. I felt judges were connecting. I felt gratified. I did not feel that connection when the other side was arguing,” said India’s lawyer at ICJ, Harish Salve. “It was a complicated subject. We worked hard and prima facie got acceptance on all our points. We are now a lot more emboldened and a lot more invigorated. When you believe in the case you do it pro bono (free of charge) and this was such a case. The government of India sought advice from me at the initial stage after which I researched about the case and gave my advice,” he added.
RECAP | International Court of Justice stays the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan. Seen as a huge victory for India over its neighbour, External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj in a series of tweets says, “The ICJ order has come as a great relief to the family of Kulbhushan Jadhav and people of India. We are grateful to Harish Salve for presenting India's case so effectively before ICJ.

Karti Chidambaram Leaves for London, ED Books Him the Day After
New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday registered a money laundering case against Karti Chidambaram, adding to the troubles of former finance P Chidambaram’s son who is currently in the United Kingdom.
The probe agency registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), ED's equivalent of a police FIR, against the accused named in a CBI complaint, including Karti, INX media and its directors, Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The ECIR has been registered under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Karti left for London on Thursday, two days after the CBI carried out searches at his home and offices across four cities for allegedly receiving money from the media firm owned by the Mukerjeas to scuttle a tax probe. Both Karti and his father said it was a “scheduled trip” and that he would return soon.

The CBI had filed an FIR against Karti and the Mukerjeas on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, receiving illegal gratification, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.
It is alleged that Karti received money from INX Media for using his influence to manipulate a tax probe against it in a case of violation of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) conditions to receive investment from Mauritius.
These vouchers were issued in favour of Advantage Strategic Consulting (P) Limited, a firm "indirectly" owned by Karti, the CBI had alleged.
The senior Chidambaram, after the CBI searches on May 16, had issued a strong statement in response to the raids saying that the government was using the CBI and other agencies to target his son.
FIPB approval was granted in "hundreds of cases", the senior Congress leader had said.

New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday registered a money laundering case against Karti Chidambaram, adding to the troubles of former finance P Chidambaram’s son who is currently in the United Kingdom.
The probe agency registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), ED's equivalent of a police FIR, against the accused named in a CBI complaint, including Karti, INX media and its directors, Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The ECIR has been registered under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Karti left for London on Thursday, two days after the CBI carried out searches at his home and offices across four cities for allegedly receiving money from the media firm owned by the Mukerjeas to scuttle a tax probe. Both Karti and his father said it was a “scheduled trip” and that he would return soon.

The CBI had filed an FIR against Karti and the Mukerjeas on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, receiving illegal gratification, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.
It is alleged that Karti received money from INX Media for using his influence to manipulate a tax probe against it in a case of violation of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) conditions to receive investment from Mauritius.
These vouchers were issued in favour of Advantage Strategic Consulting (P) Limited, a firm "indirectly" owned by Karti, the CBI had alleged.
The senior Chidambaram, after the CBI searches on May 16, had issued a strong statement in response to the raids saying that the government was using the CBI and other agencies to target his son.

Delhi HC Seeks Maran Brothers' Reply on ED's Plea
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court today sought a response from former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran and others on an Enforcement Directorate (ED) plea against their discharge in the Aircel- Maxis case.
ED had, on May 2, moved the High Court challenging a special court's February 2 order discharging the Maran brothers and others in the Aircel-Maxis money laundering case.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini, while discharging them, had also said that no prima facie case warranting framing of charges against any of the accused was made out on the basis of the materials placed on record before it.
In the money laundering case, ED had chargesheeted the Maran brothers, Kalanithi's wife Kavery, Managing Director of South Asia FM Ltd (SAFL) K Shanmugam, SAFL and Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd (SDTPL) under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The special court, in two separate orders, had said that the case was based on the foundation that Dayanidhi and Sarma deliberately delayed the approval relating to several issues, including the issuance of UAS licences to Aircel, to force Chennai-based promoter C Sivasankaran to exit from the telecom sector.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP. The date of the hackathon — the poll panel’s open challenge to technocrats and political parties — is also likely to be announced on Saturday.
The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

The Election Commission had on May 12 met the representatives of seven national parties and 35 state parties to reassure them that EVMs cannot be tampered with. After the meeting, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had alleged that the poll panel had backtracked the promise to conduct a hackathon. The EC, however, has said that the challenge was on and the date would be announced soon.

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP. The date of the hackathon — the poll panel’s open challenge to technocrats and political parties — is also likely to be announced on Saturday.
The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Blow-by-blow Account of How India Trumped Pakistan at World Court
New Delhi:  With the International Court of Justice staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav until the final verdict, India has emphatically won the first and the most important round of its legal battle against Pakistan at the global arena.
This, without a shred of doubt, is the most important reprieve at the moment since stalling Jadhav's execution was an imminent need. Without a stay on the execution, the entire purpose of invoking ICJ's jurisdiction would have been frustrated and the exercise would have been rendered an academic one to examine issues of jurisdiction, conventions etc.
Here are the five reasons outlined by News18 earlier in the day, predicting a propitious outcome, and how the ICJ ruled on these points:
Reason 1: India has been very meticulous and succinct in asking for a limited relief. What it prays for now is a stay on Jadhav's execution. If the stay is granted, not just that main relief will have to be adjudicated, but India will get time to look for a diplomatic and political solution.
ICJ ruling: India's claim for the limited relief at this juncture is justified on the principles of international law. The execution has to be stayed until we finally decide the matter on aspects of jurisdiction and applicability of Vienna Convention.
News18 was the first to tell you exactly why the balance was tilted in India’s favour in this battle.
Reason 2: India's counsel Harish Salve has aptly pre-empted Pakistan’s argument on the 2008 bilateral treaty between the two countries. While Pakistan contends India cannot be allowed to invoke Vienna Convention in the wake of the bilateral treaty, Salve has maintained that bilateral treaty cannot affect India's right to protect its citizens under the Vienna Convention. Salve was unequivocal that bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan is supposed to supplant other conventions in line with their common objectives and can’t frustrate the goals.
ICJ ruling: The 2008 treaty per se doesn't oust our jurisdiction nor was it a specific bar on India's right to ask for consular access from another country under the Vienna Convention.
Reason 3: Pakistan's argument that consular access is a matter of discretion for a law enforcement agency when the foreign national has been accused of spying has also been met by India. India has questioned various facts of the case, including how Jadhav was abducted from Iran, why India's repeated requests for consular access were shot down by Pakistan, trial was conducted without informing Jadhav and without supplying copy of the chargesheet or even the judgment. The moot point that India has appealed: Graver the charges, greater the need for continued adherence to the Vienna Convention, for it would involve life of people and relations between States.
ICJ ruling: India has been seeking consular access for Jadhav for almost a year, but to no avail. Pakistan said it would consider India's request only after Indian authorities help them in providing evidence to hold Jadhav guilty of espionage.
Reason 4: Pakistan has complained India is unwilling to explain the false passport, which bore a Muslim name and was found in Jadhav's possession. But if Pakistan wants India to explain this, then why not grant the consular access thereby accepting India's role in the adjudication process. Pakistan may just fall in a trap of its own, should the ICJ accept this argument.
ICJ ruling: Indian High Commission has time and again accepted Jadhav as an Indian national and has also given documents to the Pakistani counterpart in corroboration.
Reason 5: Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav’s legal remedies have not exhausted and hence there is no "urgency" to seek "Provisional Measures". But India has successfully demonstrated there is no stay on Jadhav’s execution and he could be executed any moment, necessitating the urgent intervention.
ICJ ruling: India has successfully established links between 'provisional measures' and India's rights to claim so. India has rightly invoked urgency clause and that irreparable prejudice to India's rights will be caused if Jadhav is executed.
International law is as good a law as countries consider it to be. It is, after all, a law without direct sanctions and Pakistan may even choose to defy the order since it's in favour of India. But it will do so at the peril of its international stature, obligation and future remedies that it may seek for its citizens.
Although Pakistan had told the ICJ that Jadhav's execution won't happen before August 2017, the ICJ did not only issue a specific order staying the execution till the proceedings before it are over, but also reminded Pakistan that it must be restrained in accordance with international obligations and global commitments to ensure free and fair justice to all.

Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Meet the 'Wise Men' Behind the ICJ Ruling
The Hague: The ICJ verdict on Thursday staying former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav's execution was pronounced by its head Ronny Abraham, an international human rights law expert who has served in the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
After months of bilateral tension, the ICJ ruling has come as a great relief to Jadhav's family and the people of India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing satisfaction on the judgment.
The UN's highest judicial body, which had earlier provisionally stayed Jadhav's sentence on May 9, also instructed Pakistan to inform it "of all the measures taken in implementation of the present order".

Abraham also served as the "Director of Legal Affairs at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1998-2005)", according to the ICJ website.
Before his appointment to the ICJ, he served, from 1998 to 2005, as the head of the Legal Affairs Directorate at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in charge of advising the government on legal matters in the fields of general international public law, European Union law, international human rights law, the law of the sea and the Antarctic.
He also spent time in academia, being a professor of international law, at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (until 1998).

Woman Donates Womb to Daughter in India's 1st Uterus Transplant
Pune: A team of doctors in the city on Thursday successfully performed India's first womb (uterus) transplant on a 21-year-old woman.
The woman, who was born without a uterus was fitted her mother's uterus so that she can conceive normally, reported PTI.
A team of 12 doctors, headed by Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, performed the surgery which started at 12 noon on Thursday and ended at 9.15 pm at Galaxy Care Laparoscopy Institute in the city.
"The patient was born without a uterus and she wanted to have her own baby and was not ready for adoption or surrogacy. Since they knew about the uterus transplant, they approached us and accepted the surgery option," Dr Shailesh Puntambekar said.
"Fortunately, her mother was found to be a medically suitable uterus donor for her," he added.
The younger woman is now under observation and will be kept in Intensive Care Unit for some days.
Dr Puntambekar said this was the first uterus or womb transplant in India.
The first successful uterine transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013. Twenty-five such surgeries have been performed around the world so far.

Introduction of Electoral Bonds a Retrograde Step, EC Tells Parliament Panel
New Delhi: The Election Commission on Friday told a Parliamentary Committee that electoral bonds introduced by the government is a "retrograde" step as it would compromise transparency in political funding.
The Commission, in a written submission to the parliamentary standing committee on Law and Personnel, said changes made in the election laws after the introduction of the bonds would compromise transparency in political fundings.
"The amendment in section 29 C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 making it no longer necessary to report details of donations received through electoral bonds is a retrograde step as transparency of political funding would be compromised as a result of the change," it said.
Senior Commission officials, including Deputy Election Commissioners Umesh Sinha and Vijay Dev, had appeared before the committee today to speak on EVMs, paper trail machines and electoral reforms.

Day After ICJ Stayed Jadhav's Execution, Pakistan Seeks Re-hearing: Reports
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav’s execution, Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the ICJ seeking a re-hearing in the case, Dunya News reported.
On Thursday, India scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ asking Pakistan to take “all measures” to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
Reading out the verdict, the ICJ court dismissed Pakistan's reservations and held that it had jurisdiction in the case because of Vienna Convention."Prima facie, a dispute exists under the Vienna Convention," held the court.
The court said it considered that Pakistan's failure to provide consular access to India was under the scope of Vienna Convention.
"Acts alleged by India fall in the Vienna Convention, which guarantees the state to be given access to its citizen," said the ICJ verdict.
In another blow to Pakistan, the court said that the circumstances in which Jadhav was arrested remained "disputed".

Kerala Assembly Passes Resolution Against GM Mustard
New Delhi: A resolution was passed in the Kerala Assembly on Friday demanding that the Centre withdraw permission for production and cultivation of Genetically Modified Mustard.
GM crops would be cultivated in the country if it was also approved by the Environment Ministry and 'it is a very serious issue', he was quoted as saying by PTI.
He demanded that the Centre not implement GEAC's decision as GM seeds would adversely affect farmers and the agriculture sector.
It would destroy traditional seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for their cultivation.
He said most states are also against GM crops.
Kumar said it has not yet been proved if GM crops would result in more yields, and claimed that it has been found that GM seeds attracts new insects.
Powerful pesticides would have to be used to safeguard crops from attacks of these insects, which in turn would harm human health, he pointed out.
GM trials were progressing in 75 varieties of crops and their target was to get approval for all crops one by one after getting sanction for GM mustard, he alleged.
"This move is dangerous to the country, farmers and also the agriculture sector", he said adding GM crops are against the interest of the people.
Congress led UDF Opposition leader supported the resolution and wanted a detailed discussion on the matter, to which the Minister said government would hold a debate in due course.

Inter-State High-Tech Sex Racket Busted in Bhopal, BJP Leader Arrested
Bhopal: The cyber cell of the Madhya Pradesh police have busted a sex racket and arrested nine people including a Bharatiya Janata Party office bearer here on Friday.
The police detected the racket in a flat in the posh Arera Colony of the city and freed four girls from Maharashtra and Meghalaya.
It came to light after the cyber unit of the state police received a complaint regarding a sex racket being run in Bhopal through a portal.
As the cyber cell probed into the complaint it was revealed that the portal supplied women through online booking. To avoid the police, the racket was being run from a flat in E-7 area in super posh Arera Colony.
Neeraj Shakya, who was recently appointed as SC Cell in BJP was also arrested by police in the case. Hours after the arrest, party state head Nandkumar Singh Chauhan expelled Shakya from the party.
Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, an officer from cyber cell said that the accused scanned various websites for finding CVs of women who were in need of job. Later, they would invite them to Bhopal on pretext of offering jobs such as beautician, receptionist and so on but then would force them to join flesh trade. The group was operating for the last three months.
The website is registered in New Delhi and has connection to other states as well. The police are now looking for the kingpin Subhash alias Veer Dwivedi who is absconding after the raid at his flat.

SC Declines to Stay Mandatory Aadhaar For Welfare Schemes
New Delhi: In a reprieve for the Central government, the Supreme Court on Friday refrained from staying various notifications issued under the Aadhaar Act to make unique identity number mandatory for several social welfare schemes.
A two-judge bench led by Justice A M Khanwilkar said that the court would not want to deal with the issue in piecemeal and would examine all applications against Aadhaar on June 27.
“It is appropriate if we hear all interlocutory applications together…they may involve same or similar issues,” said the bench while deferring the hearing of a plea made in a PIL filed by Shantha Sinha. Sinha is former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
Rohatgi, on his part, also made it clear that the government was not going to extend the deadline of June 30 by which various schemes such as grant of scholarships, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and various other social welfare schemes were to seek mandatory Aadhaar number.
“Today, we have 120 crore people who have Aadhaar cards but they are not here. The people who are supposed to be benefited by these schemes are not before the court but those who are not going to be affected by all, keep filing petitions after petitions,” rued the AG.
He complained that there was a similar PIL filed last year with same prayers but the apex court did not grant any interim relief. “Can they go on filing petitions after petitions which have even the same text? I can show that paragraphs in this petition are true copies of what was there in the last petition on the subject. This is abuse of the process of the court,” added Rohatgi, citing a petition moved by Lt Col (retd) S G Vombatkere in October 2016.
Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Sinha, replied that the previous petition might have similar prayers but the subject matter of the present PIL was entirely different. “These notifications were not issued when the previous petition was filed. We have come with fresh cause of actions. Besides, technicality should the last thing to be argued by the AG when we are claiming violation of fundamental rights. The court had in 2015 asked the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory and they are now in breach. The AG should not shy away from replying on merit,” said Divan.
“I am not shying away…I have fought these cases 20 times,” retorted Rohatgi, adding that Aadhaar was merely an executive scheme when the restraint orders were passed but now the Parliament has passed a law. “There cannot be any injunction against the Parliament from passing a law,” said the AG, adding that only a Constitution Bench should hear the matter.
The bench also reacted: “Mr Divan! Please don’t say that this court is not available for common citizens. This court is always available for them.” It then adjourned the matter to June 27, saying the court registry, after suitable instructions from the Chief Justice of India, will place this case before an appropriate bench.
Another bench in the top court had recently reserved its verdict on yet another challenge to linking Aadhaar with PAN cards and for filing Income-Tax returns. Newly inserted provisions in the Finance Act make it mandatory for people to have Aadhaar for validating their PAN cards and for I-T returns. The deadline to link Aadhaar for this purpose is June 30.

“It is appropriate if we hear all interlocutory applications together…they may involve same or similar issues,” said the bench while deferring the hearing of a plea made in a PIL filed by Shantha Sinha. Sinha is former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
Rohatgi, on his part, also made it clear that the government was not going to extend the deadline of June 30 by which various schemes such as grant of scholarships, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and various other social welfare schemes were to seek mandatory Aadhaar number.
“Today, we have 120 crore people who have Aadhaar cards but they are not here. The people who are supposed to be benefited by these schemes are not before the court but those who are not going to be affected by all, keep filing petitions after petitions,” rued the AG.
He complained that there was a similar PIL filed last year with same prayers but the apex court did not grant any interim relief. “Can they go on filing petitions after petitions which have even the same text? I can show that paragraphs in this petition are true copies of what was there in the last petition on the subject. This is abuse of the process of the court,” added Rohatgi, citing a petition moved by Lt Col (retd) S G Vombatkere in October 2016.
Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Sinha, replied that the previous petition might have similar prayers but the subject matter of the present PIL was entirely different. “These notifications were not issued when the previous petition was filed. We have come with fresh cause of actions. Besides, technicality should the last thing to be argued by the AG when we are claiming violation of fundamental rights. The court had in 2015 asked the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory and they are now in breach. The AG should not shy away from replying on merit,” said Divan.
“I am not shying away…I have fought these cases 20 times,” retorted Rohatgi, adding that Aadhaar was merely an executive scheme when the restraint orders were passed but now the Parliament has passed a law. “There cannot be any injunction against the Parliament from passing a law,” said the AG, adding that only a Constitution Bench should hear the matter.
The bench also reacted: “Mr Divan! Please don’t say that this court is not available for common citizens. This court is always available for them.” It then adjourned the matter to June 27, saying the court registry, after suitable instructions from the Chief Justice of India, will place this case before an appropriate bench.
Another bench in the top court had recently reserved its verdict on yet another challenge to linking Aadhaar with PAN cards and for filing Income-Tax returns. Newly inserted provisions in the Finance Act make it mandatory for people to have Aadhaar for validating their PAN cards and for I-T returns. The deadline to link Aadhaar for this purpose is June 30.

Martyr's Family on Indefinite Fast, Wants UP CM to Visit Village
Sambhal (UP): Family members of Sepoy Sudhesh Kumar, who was killed in firing by Pakistani troops along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir last year, today sat on an indefinite fast, demanding the chief minister Yogi Adityanath's visit to Pansukha Milak village.
Villagers and family members of Kumar, who laid down his life on October 16, 2016, sat on a fast in the village, claiming that despite promises by the BJP leaders, none of them visited the family again.
"We were promised sanction for a petrol pump, construction of a road and memorial in the village and renaming a village primary school in Sudesh's name by the BJP leaders, but none of the promises was met," Sudesh's brother Manoj Kumar said.
Another brother of the martyr, Anil Kumar, said they had lost trust in local BJP leaders and that was why they were demanding that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should visit them.
Sudesh's wife Kavita, mother Santosh Kumari, father Brahmpal Singh, Anil and a number of villagers began their indefinite fast.
The family had earlier too refused to perform the last rites till the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav visited them.
Brahmpal claimed, "The then chief minister had gone to a martyr's house in Etah as he was a Yadav. He should have come here too as there should not be any discrimination between martyrs."
Sudesh, hailing from Sambhal district, was killed whenPakistani Army fired on Indian Army posts along the Line of Control in Rajouri district.
As Akhilesh did not visit martyr's family, BJP leaders during assembly polls made it a political issue. BJP vice president Shiv Pratap Shukla, state general secretary Ashok Kataria and local MP Satpal Saini had also visited them and assured all help.

180 Dalit Families 'Convert' to Buddhism after Arrests of Bhim Army Activists

Lucknow: Around 180 families from Rupdi, Egri and Kapurpur villages of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh reportedly converted to Buddhism by immersing Hindu idols into a nearby canal.
“The police is intentionally harassing us. Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad is being targeted because he raised his voice against the atrocities inflicted by upper caste people on Dalits,” said Deepak, a resident of Kapurpur village.
So far, 10 FIRs have been registered against administrators of Facebook and WhatsApp accounts which were spreading rumours and inciting communal hatred in Saharanpur. The administrators named in the FIR mostly belong to the Bhim Army. Besides 10 cases registered under IT Act, Saharanpur police have lodged 14 other FIRs and have arrested 36 persons. In the past one week, 25 houses have been burnt down, 23 vehicles have been torched and several buses have been damaged.
An unregistered group and a movement as they call it, Bhim Army started as a social media phenomenon more than two years ago. In a short span of time, thousands of Dalits across the country started identifying themselves with this ‘aggressive’ and new kind of Ambedkarite politics. There are more than 40,000 Dalits who are members of this organization and it is spreading its wings outside Uttar Pradesh also.

Man's Suicide Bid Leads to Goa Bridge Collapse; Crocodiles Slow Down Rescue
Panaji: Search operations resumed on Friday at the site of a bridge collapse in south Goa with the Navy saying efforts were slowed down after locals spotted crocodiles in the Sanvordem river.
The dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem, a tributary of river Zuari, had been closed for traffic for the last four years. It collapsed on Thursday afternoon, unable to bear the weight of scores of onlookers watching a man trying to commit suicide. Fire and emergency services were at the spot, trying to save the suicidal man when the bridge collapsed.
Two persons had drowned while around 20 swam to safety. At least 14 people were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals.
"Crocodiles are seen by locals. Separate patrolling and lookout for crocodiles instituted. Chetak helicopters in search and rescue role... to search downstream. Terrain hilly and clouded," a Navy spokesperson said.
"As per local inputs, there may be two more persons missing. A helicopter sortie is being undertaken along the river for an aerial search," he said.
"The rescue operation began at 7.30 am today and efforts are on to check whether there are any more bodies in the water," Superintendent of Police (South) Shekhar Prabhudesai told PTI.
"The search operation was called off around midnight yesterday due to poor visibility. The divers from Indian Navy and a private agency which mans Goa's beaches have been pressed into service to search for the bodies," the SP said.

Panaji: Search operations resumed on Friday at the site of a bridge collapse in south Goa with the Navy saying efforts were slowed down after locals spotted crocodiles in the Sanvordem river.
The dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem, a tributary of river Zuari, had been closed for traffic for the last four years. It collapsed on Thursday afternoon, unable to bear the weight of scores of onlookers watching a man trying to commit suicide. Fire and emergency services were at the spot, trying to save the suicidal man when the bridge collapsed.
Two persons had drowned while around 20 swam to safety. At least 14 people were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals.
"Crocodiles are seen by locals. Separate patrolling and lookout for crocodiles instituted. Chetak helicopters in search and rescue role... to search downstream. Terrain hilly and clouded," a Navy spokesperson said.

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Kejriwal Opposed Note Ban as it Threatened Money Laundering: Kapil Mishra
New Delhi: Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Friday claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had opposed the demonetisation move as it threatened to "derail" his "money laundering" attempts.
Mishra told a press conference that the AAP had got money funnelled through shell companies and wondered how it accepted donations from companies that were slapped notices "for not paying VAT".
"Why did he (Kejriwal) fiercely oppose demonetisation? Why did he travel across the country against the move? Because his men, who hoard black money, were being raided by enforcement agencies," he claimed.
Kapil, who has been suspended from the AAP, also alleged that Delhi-based businessman Mukesh Kumar, who claimed to have donated Rs 2 crore to AAP in 2014, was merely a mask for "proclaimed black money offenders".
"Ten days before AAP took office in 2013, Mukesh Kumar's company was slapped a notice by the Delhi government for not paying VAT. And then this person goes on to donate Rs 2 crore to AAP," he said.
He also questioned Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for not acting against Mukesh for defaulting on VAT after coming to power in 2013.
Kejrwal's first stint as Delhi CM ended within 49 days after he quit over the Congress and BJP allegedly blocking the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill.

'Our Lawyers Were Inexperienced', 'Our Case Weak': Pak Newspapers on ICJ Verdict
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) asked Pakistan to hold off executing Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Pakistani commentators were critical of the lawyers and their legal strategy in representing the country’s case at the World Court. Here is a roundup of opinion from the top Pakistani newspapers.
‘Our Lawyers were inexperienced’Former Attorney General Irfan Qadir told Dawn News that he was shocked by the decision. “The lawyers handling these matters had no experience. The arguments had no weight. They should have been presented in a rational manner,” he said. “We need a dedicated team for Pakistan, loyal to the country. Pakistan’s jurisprudence has been ruined because of this,” he said, adding that the country needed to be better prepared with an experienced legal team.
‘Our case was inherently weak despite our counsel’s brave attempts’Lahore-based lawyer and author Yasser Latif Hamdani wrote in The Daily Times that Pakistan’s case rested on the question of whether or not the ICJ had jurisdiction, which, in turn, was based on the proposition that the India-Pakistan bilateral agreement on consular access trumps the Vienna convention. “A bilateral treaty cannot override or curtail a multilateral international convention to which a state is party,” Hamdani writes.

However, one silver lining for Pakistan is India’s decision to invoke the jurisdiction of a multilateral body. “It ends the policy of bilateralism that has been the cornerstone of India’s Pakistan policy,” Hamdani writes.
‘Nawaz Sharif should explain the outcome of the ICJ proceedings’Pakistan-tehreek-e-insaaf leader Shafqat Mehmood demanded, in The News International that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should come clean on the ICJ proceedings.
The paper quoted him as asking why the government selected a lawyer, who didn’t have a single international law case reported from the UK Supreme Court and what was the reason to engage London Queen’s Counsel who was based in Qatar? He further pressed the PM to explain why his government assigned the task to a lawyer who has never argued a case independently before the ICJ and what compelled his government to send a first year associate from Attorney General’s Office instead of AG himself to the ICJ.

SP Government Spent Rs 15 Crore to Give Rs 20 Crore Unemployment Dole: CAG
Lucknow: The erstwhile SP government led by Akhilesh Yadav spent over Rs 15 crore on programmes to distribute unemployment doles worth over Rs 20 crore, according to a report by the country's top audit body.
The latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that this took place despite the flagship unemployment allowance scheme having specific guidelines that the money should be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The account details had to be provided by beneficiaries on their application forms for availing the scheme.
In its 235-page report on the general and social sector tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, now in session, the CAG pointed out that the expenditure could have been avoided if functions were not held to distribute the dole.
It stated that the state government launched the scheme in May 2012, saying that quarterly payment was to be made in the savings accounts of beneficiaries, either in a nationalised banks or in Kshetriya Gramin Bank.
Records of the director, training and employment, UP, revealed that the department distributed Rs 20.58 crore to 1,26,521 unemployed people as allowance by organising functions in 69 districts during the year 2012-13.
The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.

The latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that this took place despite the flagship unemployment allowance scheme having specific guidelines that the money should be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The account details had to be provided by beneficiaries on their application forms for availing the scheme.
In its 235-page report on the general and social sector tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, now in session, the CAG pointed out that the expenditure could have been avoided if functions were not held to distribute the dole.
It stated that the state government launched the scheme in May 2012, saying that quarterly payment was to be made in the savings accounts of beneficiaries, either in a nationalised banks or in Kshetriya Gramin Bank.
Records of the director, training and employment, UP, revealed that the department distributed Rs 20.58 crore to 1,26,521 unemployed people as allowance by organising functions in 69 districts during the year 2012-13.
The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.

NGT Bans Open Defecation, Waste Dumping on Yamuna Floodplains
New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of Rs 5,000 for those who violated the diktat.
A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also constituted a committee headed by Delhi Jal Board CEO to oversee the execution of work pertaining to cleaning of the river and asked it to submit reports at regular intervals.
The Delhi government and the municipal corporations were directed to immediately take action against industries which operate in residential areas and are a major source of pollution to the river.
The green panel noted that almost 67 per cent of the pollution reaching the Yamuna would be treated by the two sewage treatment plants (STP) located at Delhi Gate and Najafgarh under Phase 1 of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.
The apex green panel had on May 1 ordered inspection of the STPs at Delhi Gate and Okhla with a view to ensure that wastewater was cleaned before it reached the Yamuna. It had sought a report with regard to functioning of these plants.
The tribunal was informed that a total of 14 STP projects are to be constructed to clean wastewater. Of these, seven are to be built by the Delhi Jal Board with its own funds.
The directions came as the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.

TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay Granted Bail in Rose Valley Chit Fund Scam
Cuttack: The Orissa High Court on Friday granted conditional bail to Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rose Valley Group chit fund scam.
The bench of Justice J P Das allowed the TMC leader to go on bail after depositing a sum of Rs 25 lakh in any nationalised bank and furnishing a bail bond of two sureties of Rs 50,000 each.
Among other conditions, the MP has been asked to submit his passport in the trial court and cooperate with the investigating officer, as and when required.
The bench had reserved the order on his bail plea after hearing arguments of both the prosecution and defence on May 8.
Bandyopadhyay had been arrested on January 3 by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the Rs 17,000 crore Rose Valley Chit fund case, which is being probed by the agency under the Supreme Court's directions.
Besides pleading that the senior politician from West Bengal was not involved in the scam, his counsel said that Bandyopadhyay was seriously ill and, therefore, needed to be granted bail.
The CBI has arrested another TMC MP, Tapas Pal, for his alleged involvement in the scam. The agency had earlier accused Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu and three others of defrauding investors from across the country of more than Rs 17,000 crore.

Class 12 CBSE Results: Students Anxious, But Hopeful of Low DU Cut-offs
New Delhi: While there has been no official declaration from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the Class 12 board results are expected to be declared this week. Like every year, students, this year too, are anxious about the fruits of their hard work, and what lies ahead. The only silver lining in between this panic and anxiety is the scrapping of the moderation policy.
"I’m sure everyone is anxious about the results, but with the CBSE scrapping the moderation policy, we’re at least sure that the university cutoffs will be realistic. Candidates, hopefully, will get a fair deal this time,” said Aayushi Bhardwaj, a student at Raja Ram Mohan Roy Public School who sat for the Class 12 boards.
Doing away with disparity in marking system of various education boards, Union Human Resources Development Ministry, last month, asked the boards to scrap the marks moderation policy, under which extra marks were awarded to students in certain papers that were considered to be difficult. This, in turn, is expected to bring down the high cut-offs for admission at prestigious colleges and universities.
In a meeting called by the HRD ministry, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), Indian School Certificate (ISC), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) and state boards unanimously agreed to do away with the marks moderation policy.
The move comes after CBSE, last year, had requested the HRD ministry to create consensus on phasing out of marks moderation policy, which inadvertently led to a spike in marks obtained by students of certain boards.
CBSE chairman R K Chaturvedi has reportedly asked Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to award “appropriate weightage” to CBSE students for admission to undergraduate program this year “so that they do not lose out to candidates from other state boards that inflate their Class XII results.”

The only silver lining in between this panic and anxiety is the scrapping of the moderation policy.
"I’m sure everyone is anxious about the results, but with the CBSE scrapping the moderation policy, we’re at least sure that the university cutoffs will be realistic. Candidates, hopefully, will get a fair deal this time,” said Aayushi Bhardwaj, a student at Raja Ram Mohan Roy Public School who sat for the Class 12 boards.
Doing away with disparity in marking system of various education boards, Union Human Resources Development Ministry, last month, asked the boards to scrap the marks moderation policy, under which extra marks were awarded to students in certain papers that were considered to be difficult. This, in turn, is expected to bring down the high cut-offs for admission at prestigious colleges and universities.
In a meeting called by the HRD ministry, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), Indian School Certificate (ISC), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) and state boards unanimously agreed to do away with the marks moderation policy.
The move comes after CBSE, last year, had requested the HRD ministry to create consensus on phasing out of marks moderation policy, which inadvertently led to a spike in marks obtained by students of certain boards.
CBSE chairman R K Chaturvedi has reportedly asked Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to award “appropriate weightage” to CBSE students for admission to undergraduate program this year “so that they do not lose out to candidates from other state boards that inflate their Class XII results.”

Window Closes Today But Pak Refuses to Reveal If Jadhav Has Filed an Appeal
New Delhi: The 40-day period for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence handed to him by a Pakistani military court ends on Friday.
If the appellate court rejects the appeal, Jadhav can lodge a mercy petition (with the army chief) within 60 days of the decision, that is by July 18. If the mercy petition is denied on July 19, he may lodge a mercy petition with the President of Pakistan within 90 days — by October 16.

Jadhav’s case received a boost on Thursday when the ICJ sided with India and ordered Pakistan to stay the execution till proceedings were pending with the world court. It also upheld India’s right to consular access, a request Pakistan has denied as many as 16 times.

Pakistan, which announced the sentence on Jadhav on April 10, claims its security forces arrested him from its restive Balochistan province on March 3 last year after he reportedly entered from Iran. However, India maintains that he was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.
Jadhav's case is the latest flash-point in the tensions between Pakistan and India. The two countries last faced off at the ICJ 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.

Premature for India to Celebrate ICJ Order: Sarabjit Singh's Pakistani Lawyer
Eram Agha |  News18.com
 @erampatrakar
New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.

What does this case mean for the already strained India-Pak relations?
Kubhushan’s case has a direct bearing on India-Pakistan relations. The excellent and very timely move by India to go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has attracted the attention of the whole world. The world has come to know the sensitivity and importance of this case. Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.

Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Pak Files Plea For Re-hearing at ICJ
Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking a re-hearing in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. India had scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ staying the execution of former Indian Navy officer Jadhav. The UN's highest judicial body also asked Pakistan to take "all measures" to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
India has hailed the verdict while Pakistan remains in denial over the ICJ’s jurisdiction.

RECAP | The Foreign Office spokesperson of Pakistan has reacted to the ICJ's order, staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav. "India has been trying to hide its real face" by taking the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav to ICJ. Pakistan will present solid evidence against Jadhav in the International Court,” the spokesperson said. The Pakistan foreign office also said that the International Court of Justice had no jurisdiction over the matters of national security. "India desperately tried to divert the world attention by portraying the entire case through a humanitarian angle," the statement said.

RECAP | Reacting to the stay on execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the International Court of Justice order was a serious indictment of the Pakistan's judicial system. Dalbir Kaur, the sister of Sarabjit Singh, who died in a Pakistan jail in 2013, hailed the verdict, terming it as a victory of crores of Indians.
RECAP | “As a lawyer for 40 years, you get a feel of how judges are reacting. I felt a positive energy when I was arguing the case. I felt judges were connecting. I felt gratified. I did not feel that connection when the other side was arguing,” said India’s lawyer at ICJ, Harish Salve. “It was a complicated subject. We worked hard and prima facie got acceptance on all our points. We are now a lot more emboldened and a lot more invigorated. When you believe in the case you do it pro bono (free of charge) and this was such a case. The government of India sought advice from me at the initial stage after which I researched about the case and gave my advice,” he added.

Seen as a huge victory for India over its neighbour, External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj in a series of tweets says, “The ICJ order has come as a great relief to the family of Kulbhushan Jadhav and people of India. We are grateful to Harish Salve for presenting India's case so effectively before ICJ. I assure the nation that under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi we will leave no stone unturned to save (him).”

Karti Chidambaram Leaves for London, ED Books Him the Day After
New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday registered a money laundering case against Karti Chidambaram, adding to the troubles of former finance P Chidambaram’s son who is currently in the United Kingdom.
The probe agency registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), ED's equivalent of a police FIR, against the accused named in a CBI complaint, including Karti, INX media and its directors, Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The ECIR has been registered under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Karti left for London on Thursday, two days after the CBI carried out searches at his home and offices across four cities for allegedly receiving money from the media firm owned by the Mukerjeas to scuttle a tax probe. Both Karti and his father said it was a “scheduled trip” and that he would return soon.

Delhi HC Seeks Maran Brothers' Reply on ED's Plea
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court today sought a response from former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran and others on an Enforcement Directorate (ED) plea against their discharge in the Aircel- Maxis case.
ED had, on May 2, moved the High Court challenging a special court's February 2 order discharging the Maran brothers and others in the Aircel-Maxis money laundering case.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini, while discharging them, had also said that no prima facie case warranting framing of charges against any of the accused was made out on the basis of the materials placed on record before it.
In the money laundering case, ED had chargesheeted the Maran brothers, Kalanithi's wife Kavery, Managing Director of South Asia FM Ltd (SAFL) K Shanmugam, SAFL and Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd (SDTPL) under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The special court, in two separate orders, had said that the case was based on the foundation that Dayanidhi and Sarma deliberately delayed the approval relating to several issues, including the issuance of UAS licences to Aircel, to force Chennai-based promoter C Sivasankaran to exit from the telecom sector.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

EC to Hold EVM Demo of Its Own, Decide on Hackathon Tomorrow

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP.

The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Blow-by-blow Account of How India Trumped Pakistan at World Court
New Delhi:  With the International Court of Justice staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav until the final verdict, India has emphatically won the first and the most important round of its legal battle against Pakistan at the global arena.
This, without a shred of doubt, is the most important reprieve at the moment since stalling Jadhav's execution was an imminent need. Without a stay on the execution, the entire purpose of invoking ICJ's jurisdiction would have been frustrated and the exercise would have been rendered an academic one to examine issues of jurisdiction, conventions etc.
Here are the five reasons outlined by News18 earlier in the day, predicting a propitious outcome, and how the ICJ ruled on these points:
Reason 1: India has been very meticulous and succinct in asking for a limited relief. What it prays for now is a stay on Jadhav's execution. If the stay is granted, not just that main relief will have to be adjudicated, but India will get time to look for a diplomatic and political solution.
ICJ ruling: India's claim for the limited relief at this juncture is justified on the principles of international law. The execution has to be stayed until we finally decide the matter on aspects of jurisdiction and applicability of Vienna Convention.
News18 was the first to tell you exactly why the balance was tilted in India’s favour in this battle.
Reason 2: India's counsel Harish Salve has aptly pre-empted Pakistan’s argument on the 2008 bilateral treaty between the two countries. While Pakistan contends India cannot be allowed to invoke Vienna Convention in the wake of the bilateral treaty, Salve has maintained that bilateral treaty cannot affect India's right to protect its citizens under the Vienna Convention. Salve was unequivocal that bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan is supposed to supplant other conventions in line with their common objectives and can’t frustrate the goals.
ICJ ruling: The 2008 treaty per se doesn't oust our jurisdiction nor was it a specific bar on India's right to ask for consular access from another country under the Vienna Convention.
Reason 3: Pakistan's argument that consular access is a matter of discretion for a law enforcement agency when the foreign national has been accused of spying has also been met by India. India has questioned various facts of the case, including how Jadhav was abducted from Iran, why India's repeated requests for consular access were shot down by Pakistan, trial was conducted without informing Jadhav and without supplying copy of the chargesheet or even the judgment. The moot point that India has appealed: Graver the charges, greater the need for continued adherence to the Vienna Convention, for it would involve life of people and relations between States.
ICJ ruling: India has been seeking consular access for Jadhav for almost a year, but to no avail. Pakistan said it would consider India's request only after Indian authorities help them in providing evidence to hold Jadhav guilty of espionage.
Reason 4: Pakistan has complained India is unwilling to explain the false passport, which bore a Muslim name and was found in Jadhav's possession. But if Pakistan wants India to explain this, then why not grant the consular access thereby accepting India's role in the adjudication process. Pakistan may just fall in a trap of its own, should the ICJ accept this argument.
ICJ ruling: Indian High Commission has time and again accepted Jadhav as an Indian national and has also given documents to the Pakistani counterpart in corroboration.
Reason 5: Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav’s legal remedies have not exhausted and hence there is no "urgency" to seek "Provisional Measures". But India has successfully demonstrated there is no stay on Jadhav’s execution and he could be executed any moment, necessitating the urgent intervention.
ICJ ruling: India has successfully established links between 'provisional measures' and India's rights to claim so. India has rightly invoked urgency clause and that irreparable prejudice to India's rights will be caused if Jadhav is executed.
International law is as good a law as countries consider it to be. It is, after all, a law without direct sanctions and Pakistan may even choose to defy the order since it's in favour of India. But it will do so at the peril of its international stature, obligation and future remedies that it may seek for its citizens.
Although Pakistan had told the ICJ that Jadhav's execution won't happen before August 2017, the ICJ did not only issue a specific order staying the execution till the proceedings before it are over, but also reminded Pakistan that it must be restrained in accordance with international obligations and global commitments to ensure free and fair justice to all.

Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Meet the 'Wise Men' Behind the ICJ Ruling
The Hague: The ICJ verdict on Thursday staying former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav's execution was pronounced by its head Ronny Abraham, an international human rights law expert who has served in the Court of Justice of the European Communities.

Woman Donates Womb to Daughter in India's 1st Uterus Transplant
Pune: A team of doctors in the city on Thursday successfully performed India's first womb (uterus) transplant on a 21-year-old woman.
The woman, who was born without a uterus was fitted her mother's uterus so that she can conceive normally, reported PTI.
A team of 12 doctors, headed by Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, performed the surgery which started at 12 noon on Thursday and ended at 9.15 pm at Galaxy Care Laparoscopy Institute in the city.
"The patient was born without a uterus and she wanted to have her own baby and was not ready for adoption or surrogacy. Since they knew about the uterus transplant, they approached us and accepted the surgery option," Dr Shailesh Puntambekar said.
"Fortunately, her mother was found to be a medically suitable uterus donor for her," he added.
The younger woman is now under observation and will be kept in Intensive Care Unit for some days.
Dr Puntambekar said this was the first uterus or womb transplant in India.
The first successful uterine transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013. Twenty-five such surgeries have been performed around the world so far.

The woman, who was born without a uterus was fitted her mother's uterus so that she can conceive normally, reported PTI.
A team of 12 doctors, headed by Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, performed the surgery which started at 12 noon on Thursday and ended at 9.15 pm at Galaxy Care Laparoscopy Institute in the city.
"The patient was born without a uterus and she wanted to have her own baby and was not ready for adoption or surrogacy. Since they knew about the uterus transplant, they approached us and accepted the surgery option," Dr Shailesh Puntambekar said.
"Fortunately, her mother was found to be a medically suitable uterus donor for her," he added.
The younger woman is now under observation and will be kept in Intensive Care Unit for some days.
Dr Puntambekar said this was the first uterus or womb transplant in India.
The first successful uterine transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013. Twenty-five such surgeries have been performed around the world so far.

New Delhi: Two doctors—Pawandeep Singh and Col RS Negi—whose presence in the Indian contingent to Rio Olympics came under criticism are now under the CBI’s scanner.
Sources said CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry against the two doctors and have launched a probe as to how they managed to be part of the Rio contingent.
Col RS Negi and Pawandeep Singh are radiologists and not sports medicine doctors. Sources said Col Negi has never attended any national championship.
Pawandeep’s father is Tarlochan Singh, the powerful vice-president of Indian Olympic Association, while Negi is a relative and friend of IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta.
CBI sources said they will probe the allegations of nepotism and favouritism. The investigation would also look into how they got into the Olympic contingent and who in IOA cleared their appointment.

Introduction of Electoral Bonds a Retrograde Step, EC Tells Parliament Panel
New Delhi: The Election Commission on Friday told a Parliamentary Committee that electoral bonds introduced by the government is a "retrograde" step as it would compromise transparency in political funding.
The Commission, in a written submission to the parliamentary standing committee on Law and Personnel, said changes made in the election laws after the introduction of the bonds would compromise transparency in political fundings.
"The amendment in section 29 C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 making it no longer necessary to report details of donations received through electoral bonds is a retrograde step as transparency of political funding would be compromised as a result of the change," it said.
Senior Commission officials, including Deputy Election Commissioners Umesh Sinha and Vijay Dev, had appeared before the committee today to speak on EVMs, paper trail machines and electoral reforms.

Day After ICJ Stayed Jadhav's Execution, Pakistan Seeks Re-hearing: Reports
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav’s execution, Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the ICJ seeking a re-hearing in the case, Dunya News reported.
On Thursday, India scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ asking Pakistan to take “all measures” to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
Reading out the verdict, the ICJ court dismissed Pakistan's reservations and held that it had jurisdiction in the case because of Vienna Convention."Prima facie, a dispute exists under the Vienna Convention," held the court.
The court said it considered that Pakistan's failure to provide consular access to India was under the scope of Vienna Convention.
"Acts alleged by India fall in the Vienna Convention, which guarantees the state to be given access to its citizen," said the ICJ verdict.
In another blow to Pakistan, the court said that the circumstances in which Jadhav was arrested remained "disputed".

Kerala Assembly Passes Resolution Against GM Mustard
New Delhi: A resolution was passed in the Kerala Assembly on Friday demanding that the Centre withdraw permission for production and cultivation of Genetically Modified Mustard.
GM crops would be cultivated in the country if it was also approved by the Environment Ministry and 'it is a very serious issue', he was quoted as saying by PTI.
He demanded that the Centre not implement GEAC's decision as GM seeds would adversely affect farmers and the agriculture sector.
It would destroy traditional seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for their cultivation.
He said most states are also against GM crops.
Kumar said it has not yet been proved if GM crops would result in more yields, and claimed that it has been found that GM seeds attracts new insects.
Powerful pesticides would have to be used to safeguard crops from attacks of these insects, which in turn would harm human health, he pointed out.
GM trials were progressing in 75 varieties of crops and their target was to get approval for all crops one by one after getting sanction for GM mustard, he alleged.
"This move is dangerous to the country, farmers and also the agriculture sector", he said adding GM crops are against the interest of the people.
Congress led UDF Opposition leader supported the resolution and wanted a detailed discussion on the matter, to which the Minister said government would hold a debate in due course.

SC Declines to Stay Mandatory Aadhaar For Welfare Schemes
New Delhi: In a reprieve for the Central government, the Supreme Court on Friday refrained from staying various notifications issued under the Aadhaar Act to make unique identity number mandatory for several social welfare schemes.
A two-judge bench led by Justice A M Khanwilkar said that the court would not want to deal with the issue in piecemeal and would examine all applications against Aadhaar on June 27.
“It is appropriate if we hear all interlocutory applications together…they may involve same or similar issues,” said the bench while deferring the hearing of a plea made in a PIL filed by Shantha Sinha. Sinha is former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
Rohatgi, on his part, also made it clear that the government was not going to extend the deadline of June 30 by which various schemes such as grant of scholarships, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and various other social welfare schemes were to seek mandatory Aadhaar number.
“Today, we have 120 crore people who have Aadhaar cards but they are not here. The people who are supposed to be benefited by these schemes are not before the court but those who are not going to be affected by all, keep filing petitions after petitions,” rued the AG.
He complained that there was a similar PIL filed last year with same prayers but the apex court did not grant any interim relief. “Can they go on filing petitions after petitions which have even the same text? I can show that paragraphs in this petition are true copies of what was there in the last petition on the subject. This is abuse of the process of the court,” added Rohatgi, citing a petition moved by Lt Col (retd) S G Vombatkere in October 2016.
Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Sinha, replied that the previous petition might have similar prayers but the subject matter of the present PIL was entirely different. “These notifications were not issued when the previous petition was filed. We have come with fresh cause of actions. Besides, technicality should the last thing to be argued by the AG when we are claiming violation of fundamental rights. The court had in 2015 asked the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory and they are now in breach. The AG should not shy away from replying on merit,” said Divan.
“I am not shying away…I have fought these cases 20 times,” retorted Rohatgi, adding that Aadhaar was merely an executive scheme when the restraint orders were passed but now the Parliament has passed a law. “There cannot be any injunction against the Parliament from passing a law,” said the AG, adding that only a Constitution Bench should hear the matter.
The bench also reacted: “Mr Divan! Please don’t say that this court is not available for common citizens. This court is always available for them.” It then adjourned the matter to June 27, saying the court registry, after suitable instructions from the Chief Justice of India, will place this case before an appropriate bench.
Another bench in the top court had recently reserved its verdict on yet another challenge to linking Aadhaar with PAN cards and for filing Income-Tax returns. Newly inserted provisions in the Finance Act make it mandatory for people to have Aadhaar for validating their PAN cards and for I-T returns. The deadline to link Aadhaar for this purpose is June 30.

“It is appropriate if we hear all interlocutory applications together…they may involve same or similar issues,” said the bench while deferring the hearing of a plea made in a PIL filed by Shantha Sinha. Sinha is former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
Rohatgi, on his part, also made it clear that the government was not going to extend the deadline of June 30 by which various schemes such as grant of scholarships, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and various other social welfare schemes were to seek mandatory Aadhaar number.
“Today, we have 120 crore people who have Aadhaar cards but they are not here. The people who are supposed to be benefited by these schemes are not before the court but those who are not going to be affected by all, keep filing petitions after petitions,” rued the AG.
He complained that there was a similar PIL filed last year with same prayers but the apex court did not grant any interim relief. “Can they go on filing petitions after petitions which have even the same text? I can show that paragraphs in this petition are true copies of what was there in the last petition on the subject. This is abuse of the process of the court,” added Rohatgi, citing a petition moved by Lt Col (retd) S G Vombatkere in October 2016.
Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Sinha, replied that the previous petition might have similar prayers but the subject matter of the present PIL was entirely different. “These notifications were not issued when the previous petition was filed. We have come with fresh cause of actions. Besides, technicality should the last thing to be argued by the AG when we are claiming violation of fundamental rights. The court had in 2015 asked the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory and they are now in breach. The AG should not shy away from replying on merit,” said Divan.
“I am not shying away…I have fought these cases 20 times,” retorted Rohatgi, adding that Aadhaar was merely an executive scheme when the restraint orders were passed but now the Parliament has passed a law. “There cannot be any injunction against the Parliament from passing a law,” said the AG, adding that only a Constitution Bench should hear the matter.
The bench also reacted: “Mr Divan! Please don’t say that this court is not available for common citizens. This court is always available for them.” It then adjourned the matter to June 27, saying the court registry, after suitable instructions from the Chief Justice of India, will place this case before an appropriate bench.
Another bench in the top court had recently reserved its verdict on yet another challenge to linking Aadhaar with PAN cards and for filing Income-Tax returns. Newly inserted provisions in the Finance Act make it mandatory for people to have Aadhaar for validating their PAN cards and for I-T returns. The deadline to link Aadhaar for this purpose is June 30.
Martyr's Family on Indefinite Fast, Wants UP CM to Visit Village
Sambhal (UP): Family members of Sepoy Sudhesh Kumar, who was killed in firing by Pakistani troops along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir last year, today sat on an indefinite fast, demanding the chief minister Yogi Adityanath's visit to Pansukha Milak village.
Villagers and family members of Kumar, who laid down his life on October 16, 2016, sat on a fast in the village, claiming that despite promises by the BJP leaders, none of them visited the family again.
"We were promised sanction for a petrol pump, construction of a road and memorial in the village and renaming a village primary school in Sudesh's name by the BJP leaders, but none of the promises was met," Sudesh's brother Manoj Kumar said.
Another brother of the martyr, Anil Kumar, said they had lost trust in local BJP leaders and that was why they were demanding that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should visit them.
Sudesh's wife Kavita, mother Santosh Kumari, father Brahmpal Singh, Anil and a number of villagers began their indefinite fast.
The family had earlier too refused to perform the last rites till the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav visited them.
Brahmpal claimed, "The then chief minister had gone to a martyr's house in Etah as he was a Yadav. He should have come here too as there should not be any discrimination between martyrs."
Sudesh, hailing from Sambhal district, was killed whenPakistani Army fired on Indian Army posts along the Line of Control in Rajouri district.
As Akhilesh did not visit martyr's family, BJP leaders during assembly polls made it a political issue. BJP vice president Shiv Pratap Shukla, state general secretary Ashok Kataria and local MP Satpal Saini had also visited them and assured all help.

180 Dalit Families 'Convert' to Buddhism after Arrests of Bhim Army Activists
Qazi Faraz Ahmad |  News18.com
 @qazifarazahmad
Lucknow: Around 180 families from Rupdi, Egri and Kapurpur villages of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh reportedly converted to Buddhism by immersing Hindu idols into a nearby canal.
“The police is intentionally harassing us. Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad is being targeted because he raised his voice against the atrocities inflicted by upper caste people on Dalits,” said Deepak, a resident of Kapurpur village.
So far, 10 FIRs have been registered against administrators of Facebook and WhatsApp accounts which were spreading rumours and inciting communal hatred in Saharanpur. The administrators named in the FIR mostly belong to the Bhim Army. Besides 10 cases registered under IT Act, Saharanpur police have lodged 14 other FIRs and have arrested 36 persons. In the past one week, 25 houses have been burnt down, 23 vehicles have been torched and several buses have been damaged.
An unregistered group and a movement as they call it, Bhim Army started as a social media phenomenon more than two years ago. In a short span of time, thousands of Dalits across the country started identifying themselves with this ‘aggressive’ and new kind of Ambedkarite politics. There are more than 40,000 Dalits who are members of this organization and it is spreading its wings outside Uttar Pradesh also.

Man's Suicide Bid Leads to Goa Bridge Collapse; Crocodiles Slow Down Rescue
Panaji: Search operations resumed on Friday at the site of a bridge collapse in south Goa with the Navy saying efforts were slowed down after locals spotted crocodiles in the Sanvordem river.
The dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem, a tributary of river Zuari, had been closed for traffic for the last four years. It collapsed on Thursday afternoon, unable to bear the weight of scores of onlookers watching a man trying to commit suicide. Fire and emergency services were at the spot, trying to save the suicidal man when the bridge collapsed.
Two persons had drowned while around 20 swam to safety. At least 14 people were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals.
"Crocodiles are seen by locals. Separate patrolling and lookout for crocodiles instituted. Chetak helicopters in search and rescue role... to search downstream. Terrain hilly and clouded," a Navy spokesperson said.
"As per local inputs, there may be two more persons missing. A helicopter sortie is being undertaken along the river for an aerial search," he said.
"The rescue operation began at 7.30 am today and efforts are on to check whether there are any more bodies in the water," Superintendent of Police (South) Shekhar Prabhudesai told PTI.
"The search operation was called off around midnight yesterday due to poor visibility. The divers from Indian Navy and a private agency which mans Goa's beaches have been pressed into service to search for the bodies," the SP said.

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Kejriwal Opposed Note Ban as it Threatened Money Laundering: Kapil Mishra
New Delhi: Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Friday claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had opposed the demonetisation move as it threatened to "derail" his "money laundering" attempts.
Mishra told a press conference that the AAP had got money funnelled through shell companies and wondered how it accepted donations from companies that were slapped notices "for not paying VAT".
"Why did he (Kejriwal) fiercely oppose demonetisation? Why did he travel across the country against the move? Because his men, who hoard black money, were being raided by enforcement agencies," he claimed.
Kapil, who has been suspended from the AAP, also alleged that Delhi-based businessman Mukesh Kumar, who claimed to have donated Rs 2 crore to AAP in 2014, was merely a mask for "proclaimed black money offenders".
"Ten days before AAP took office in 2013, Mukesh Kumar's company was slapped a notice by the Delhi government for not paying VAT. And then this person goes on to donate Rs 2 crore to AAP," he said.
He also questioned Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for not acting against Mukesh for defaulting on VAT after coming to power in 2013.
Kejrwal's first stint as Delhi CM ended within 49 days after he quit over the Congress and BJP allegedly blocking the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill.

'Our Lawyers Were Inexperienced', 'Our Case Weak': Pak Newspapers on ICJ Verdict
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) asked Pakistan to hold off executing Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Pakistani commentators were critical of the lawyers and their legal strategy in representing the country’s case at the World Court. Here is a roundup of opinion from the top Pakistani newspapers.
‘Our Lawyers were inexperienced’Former Attorney General Irfan Qadir told Dawn News that he was shocked by the decision. “The lawyers handling these matters had no experience. The arguments had no weight. They should have been presented in a rational manner,” he said. “We need a dedicated team for Pakistan, loyal to the country. Pakistan’s jurisprudence has been ruined because of this,” he said, adding that the country needed to be better prepared with an experienced legal team.
‘Our case was inherently weak despite our counsel’s brave attempts’Lahore-based lawyer and author Yasser Latif Hamdani wrote in The Daily Times that Pakistan’s case rested on the question of whether or not the ICJ had jurisdiction, which, in turn, was based on the proposition that the India-Pakistan bilateral agreement on consular access trumps the Vienna convention. “A bilateral treaty cannot override or curtail a multilateral international convention to which a state is party,” Hamdani writes.

However, one silver lining for Pakistan is India’s decision to invoke the jurisdiction of a multilateral body. “It ends the policy of bilateralism that has been the cornerstone of India’s Pakistan policy,” Hamdani writes.
‘Nawaz Sharif should explain the outcome of the ICJ proceedings’Pakistan-tehreek-e-insaaf leader Shafqat Mehmood demanded, in The News International that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should come clean on the ICJ proceedings.
The paper quoted him as asking why the government selected a lawyer, who didn’t have a single international law case reported from the UK Supreme Court and what was the reason to engage London Queen’s Counsel who was based in Qatar? He further pressed the PM to explain why his government assigned the task to a lawyer who has never argued a case independently before the ICJ and what compelled his government to send a first year associate from Attorney General’s Office instead of AG himself to the ICJ.

SP Government Spent Rs 15 Crore to Give Rs 20 Crore Unemployment Dole: CAG
Lucknow: The erstwhile SP government led by Akhilesh Yadav spent over Rs 15 crore on programmes to distribute unemployment doles worth over Rs 20 crore, according to a report by the country's top audit body.
The latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that this took place despite the flagship unemployment allowance scheme having specific guidelines that the money should be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The account details had to be provided by beneficiaries on their application forms for availing the scheme.
In its 235-page report on the general and social sector tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, now in session, the CAG pointed out that the expenditure could have been avoided if functions were not held to distribute the dole.
It stated that the state government launched the scheme in May 2012, saying that quarterly payment was to be made in the savings accounts of beneficiaries, either in a nationalised banks or in Kshetriya Gramin Bank.
Records of the director, training and employment, UP, revealed that the department distributed Rs 20.58 crore to 1,26,521 unemployed people as allowance by organising functions in 69 districts during the year 2012-13.
The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.

The latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that this took place despite the flagship unemployment allowance scheme having specific guidelines that the money should be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The account details had to be provided by beneficiaries on their application forms for availing the scheme.
In its 235-page report on the general and social sector tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, now in session, the CAG pointed out that the expenditure could have been avoided if functions were not held to distribute the dole.
It stated that the state government launched the scheme in May 2012, saying that quarterly payment was to be made in the savings accounts of beneficiaries, either in a nationalised banks or in Kshetriya Gramin Bank.
Records of the director, training and employment, UP, revealed that the department distributed Rs 20.58 crore to 1,26,521 unemployed people as allowance by organising functions in 69 districts during the year 2012-13.
The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.

NGT Bans Open Defecation, Waste Dumping on Yamuna Floodplains
New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of Rs 5,000 for those who violated the diktat.
A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also constituted a committee headed by Delhi Jal Board CEO to oversee the execution of work pertaining to cleaning of the river and asked it to submit reports at regular intervals.
The Delhi government and the municipal corporations were directed to immediately take action against industries which operate in residential areas and are a major source of pollution to the river.
The green panel noted that almost 67 per cent of the pollution reaching the Yamuna would be treated by the two sewage treatment plants (STP) located at Delhi Gate and Najafgarh under Phase 1 of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.
The apex green panel had on May 1 ordered inspection of the STPs at Delhi Gate and Okhla with a view to ensure that wastewater was cleaned before it reached the Yamuna. It had sought a report with regard to functioning of these plants.
The tribunal was informed that a total of 14 STP projects are to be constructed to clean wastewater. Of these, seven are to be built by the Delhi Jal Board with its own funds.
The directions came as the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.

TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay Granted Bail in Rose Valley Chit Fund Scam
Cuttack: The Orissa High Court on Friday granted conditional bail to Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rose Valley Group chit fund scam.
The bench of Justice J P Das allowed the TMC leader to go on bail after depositing a sum of Rs 25 lakh in any nationalised bank and furnishing a bail bond of two sureties of Rs 50,000 each.
Among other conditions, the MP has been asked to submit his passport in the trial court and cooperate with the investigating officer, as and when required.
The bench had reserved the order on his bail plea after hearing arguments of both the prosecution and defence on May 8.
Bandyopadhyay had been arrested on January 3 by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the Rs 17,000 crore Rose Valley Chit fund case, which is being probed by the agency under the Supreme Court's directions.
Besides pleading that the senior politician from West Bengal was not involved in the scam, his counsel said that Bandyopadhyay was seriously ill and, therefore, needed to be granted bail.
The CBI has arrested another TMC MP, Tapas Pal, for his alleged involvement in the scam. The agency had earlier accused Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu and three others of defrauding investors from across the country of more than Rs 17,000 crore.

Class 12 CBSE Results: Students Anxious, But Hopeful of Low DU Cut-offs
New Delhi: While there has been no official declaration from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the Class 12 board results are expected to be declared this week. Like every year, students, this year too, are anxious about the fruits of their hard work, and what lies ahead. The only silver lining in between this panic and anxiety is the scrapping of the moderation policy.
"I’m sure everyone is anxious about the results, but with the CBSE scrapping the moderation policy, we’re at least sure that the university cutoffs will be realistic. Candidates, hopefully, will get a fair deal this time,” said Aayushi Bhardwaj, a student at Raja Ram Mohan Roy Public School who sat for the Class 12 boards.
Doing away with disparity in marking system of various education boards, Union Human Resources Development Ministry, last month, asked the boards to scrap the marks moderation policy, under which extra marks were awarded to students in certain papers that were considered to be difficult. This, in turn, is expected to bring down the high cut-offs for admission at prestigious colleges and universities.
In a meeting called by the HRD ministry, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), Indian School Certificate (ISC), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) and state boards unanimously agreed to do away with the marks moderation policy.
The move comes after CBSE, last year, had requested the HRD ministry to create consensus on phasing out of marks moderation policy, which inadvertently led to a spike in marks obtained by students of certain boards.
CBSE chairman R K Chaturvedi has reportedly asked Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to award “appropriate weightage” to CBSE students for admission to undergraduate program this year “so that they do not lose out to candidates from other state boards that inflate their Class XII results.”

Window Closes Today But Pak Refuses to Reveal If Jadhav Has Filed an Appeal
New Delhi: The 40-day period for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence handed to him by a Pakistani military court ends on Friday.
If the appellate court rejects the appeal, Jadhav can lodge a mercy petition (with the army chief) within 60 days of the decision, that is by July 18. If the mercy petition is denied on July 19, he may lodge a mercy petition with the President of Pakistan within 90 days — by October 16.

Jadhav’s case received a boost on Thursday when the ICJ sided with India and ordered Pakistan to stay the execution till proceedings were pending with the world court. It also upheld India’s right to consular access, a request Pakistan has denied as many as 16 times.

Pakistan, which announced the sentence on Jadhav on April 10, claims its security forces arrested him from its restive Balochistan province on March 3 last year after he reportedly entered from Iran.

Jadhav's case is the latest flash-point in the tensions between Pakistan and India. The two countries last faced off at the ICJ 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.

New Delhi: The 40-day period for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence handed to him by a Pakistani military court ends on Friday.
If the appellate court rejects the appeal, Jadhav can lodge a mercy petition (with the army chief) within 60 days of the decision, that is by July 18. If the mercy petition is denied on July 19, he may lodge a mercy petition with the President of Pakistan within 90 days — by October 16.

Jadhav’s case received a boost on Thursday when the ICJ sided with India and ordered Pakistan to stay the execution till proceedings were pending with the world court. It also upheld India’s right to consular access, a request Pakistan has denied as many as 16 times.

Pakistan, which announced the sentence on Jadhav on April 10, claims its security forces arrested him from its restive Balochistan province on March 3 last year after he reportedly entered from Iran. However, India maintains that he was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.

Premature for India to Celebrate ICJ Order: Sarabjit Singh's Pakistani Lawyer
Eram Agha |  News18.com
 @erampatrakar
New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.

What does this case mean for the already strained India-Pak relations?
Kubhushan’s case has a direct bearing on India-Pakistan relations. The excellent and very timely move by India to go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has attracted the attention of the whole world. The world has come to know the sensitivity and importance of this case. Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.

What does this case mean for the already strained India-Pak relations?
Kubhushan’s case has a direct bearing on India-Pakistan relations. The excellent and very timely move by India to go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has attracted the attention of the whole world. The world has come to know the sensitivity and importance of this case. Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Pak Files Plea For Re-hearing at ICJ
Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking a re-hearing in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. India had scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ staying the execution of former Indian Navy officer Jadhav. The UN's highest judicial body also asked Pakistan to take "all measures" to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
India has hailed the verdict while Pakistan remains in denial over the ICJ’s jurisdiction.

RECAP | The Foreign Office spokesperson of Pakistan has reacted to the ICJ's order, staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav. "India has been trying to hide its real face" by taking the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav to ICJ. Pakistan will present solid evidence against Jadhav in the International Court,” the spokesperson said. The Pakistan foreign office also said that the International Court of Justice had no jurisdiction over the matters of national security. "India desperately tried to divert the world attention by portraying the entire case through a humanitarian angle," the statement said.

We are grateful to Harish Salve for presenting India's case so effectively before ICJ.

Karti Chidambaram Leaves for London, ED Books Him the Day After
New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday registered a money laundering case against Karti Chidambaram, adding to the troubles of former finance P Chidambaram’s son who is currently in the United Kingdom.
The probe agency registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), ED's equivalent of a police FIR, against the accused named in a CBI complaint, including Karti, INX media and its directors, Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The ECIR has been registered under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Karti left for London on Thursday, two days after the CBI carried out searches at his home and offices across four cities for allegedly receiving money from the media firm owned by the Mukerjeas to scuttle a tax probe. Both Karti and his father said it was a “scheduled trip” and that he would return soon.

The CBI had filed an FIR against Karti and the Mukerjeas on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, receiving illegal gratification, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.
It is alleged that Karti received money from INX Media for using his influence to manipulate a tax probe against it in a case of violation of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) conditions to receive investment from Mauritius.
These vouchers were issued in favour of Advantage Strategic Consulting (P) Limited, a firm "indirectly" owned by Karti, the CBI had alleged.
The senior Chidambaram, after the CBI searches on May 16, had issued a strong statement in response to the raids saying that the government was using the CBI and other agencies to target his son.
FIPB approval was granted in "hundreds of cases", the senior Congress leader had said.

Delhi HC Seeks Maran Brothers' Reply on ED's Plea
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court today sought a response from former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran and others on an Enforcement Directorate (ED) plea against their discharge in the Aircel- Maxis case.
ED had, on May 2, moved the High Court challenging a special court's February 2 order discharging the Maran brothers and others in the Aircel-Maxis money laundering case.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini, while discharging them, had also said that no prima facie case warranting framing of charges against any of the accused was made out on the basis of the materials placed on record before it.
In the money laundering case, ED had chargesheeted the Maran brothers, Kalanithi's wife Kavery, Managing Director of South Asia FM Ltd (SAFL) K Shanmugam, SAFL and Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd (SDTPL) under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The special court, in two separate orders, had said that the case was based on the foundation that Dayanidhi and Sarma deliberately delayed the approval relating to several issues, including the issuance of UAS licences to Aircel, to force Chennai-based promoter C Sivasankaran to exit from the telecom sector.

ED had, on May 2, moved the High Court challenging a special court's February 2 order discharging the Maran brothers and others in the Aircel-Maxis money laundering case.
Special CBI Judge O P Saini, while discharging them, had also said that no prima facie case warranting framing of charges against any of the accused was made out on the basis of the materials placed on record before it.
In the money laundering case, ED had chargesheeted the Maran brothers, Kalanithi's wife Kavery, Managing Director of South Asia FM Ltd (SAFL) K Shanmugam, SAFL and Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd (SDTPL) under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The special court, in two separate orders, had said that the case was based on the foundation that Dayanidhi and Sarma deliberately delayed the approval relating to several issues, including the issuance of UAS licences to Aircel, to force Chennai-based promoter C Sivasankaran to exit from the telecom sector.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP. The date of the hackathon — the poll panel’s open challenge to technocrats and political parties — is also likely to be announced on Saturday.
The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

After the meeting, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had alleged that the poll panel had backtracked the promise to conduct a hackathon. The EC, however, has said that the challenge was on and the date would be announced soon.

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP.

The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.

New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.

Blow-by-blow Account of How India Trumped Pakistan at World Court
New Delhi:  With the International Court of Justice staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav until the final verdict, India has emphatically won the first and the most important round of its legal battle against Pakistan at the global arena.
This, without a shred of doubt, is the most important reprieve at the moment since stalling Jadhav's execution was an imminent need. Without a stay on the execution, the entire purpose of invoking ICJ's jurisdiction would have been frustrated and the exercise would have been rendered an academic one to examine issues of jurisdiction, conventions etc.
Here are the five reasons outlined by News18 earlier in the day, predicting a propitious outcome, and how the ICJ ruled on these points:
Reason 1: India has been very meticulous and succinct in asking for a limited relief. What it prays for now is a stay on Jadhav's execution. If the stay is granted, not just that main relief will have to be adjudicated, but India will get time to look for a diplomatic and political solution.
ICJ ruling: India's claim for the limited relief at this juncture is justified on the principles of international law. The execution has to be stayed until we finally decide the matter on aspects of jurisdiction and applicability of Vienna Convention.
News18 was the first to tell you exactly why the balance was tilted in India’s favour in this battle.
Reason 2: India's counsel Harish Salve has aptly pre-empted Pakistan’s argument on the 2008 bilateral treaty between the two countries. While Pakistan contends India cannot be allowed to invoke Vienna Convention in the wake of the bilateral treaty, Salve has maintained that bilateral treaty cannot affect India's right to protect its citizens under the Vienna Convention. Salve was unequivocal that bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan is supposed to supplant other conventions in line with their common objectives and can’t frustrate the goals.
ICJ ruling: The 2008 treaty per se doesn't oust our jurisdiction nor was it a specific bar on India's right to ask for consular access from another country under the Vienna Convention.
Reason 3: Pakistan's argument that consular access is a matter of discretion for a law enforcement agency when the foreign national has been accused of spying has also been met by India. India has questioned various facts of the case, including how Jadhav was abducted from Iran, why India's repeated requests for consular access were shot down by Pakistan, trial was conducted without informing Jadhav and without supplying copy of the chargesheet or even the judgment. The moot point that India has appealed: Graver the charges, greater the need for continued adherence to the Vienna Convention, for it would involve life of people and relations between States.
ICJ ruling: India has been seeking consular access for Jadhav for almost a year, but to no avail. Pakistan said it would consider India's request only after Indian authorities help them in providing evidence to hold Jadhav guilty of espionage.
Reason 4: Pakistan has complained India is unwilling to explain the false passport, which bore a Muslim name and was found in Jadhav's possession. But if Pakistan wants India to explain this, then why not grant the consular access thereby accepting India's role in the adjudication process. Pakistan may just fall in a trap of its own, should the ICJ accept this argument.
ICJ ruling: Indian High Commission has time and again accepted Jadhav as an Indian national and has also given documents to the Pakistani counterpart in corroboration.
Reason 5: Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav’s legal remedies have not exhausted and hence there is no "urgency" to seek "Provisional Measures". But India has successfully demonstrated there is no stay on Jadhav’s execution and he could be executed any moment, necessitating the urgent intervention.
ICJ ruling: India has successfully established links between 'provisional measures' and India's rights to claim so. India has rightly invoked urgency clause and that irreparable prejudice to India's rights will be caused if Jadhav is executed.
International law is as good a law as countries consider it to be. It is, after all, a law without direct sanctions and Pakistan may even choose to defy the order since it's in favour of India. But it will do so at the peril of its international stature, obligation and future remedies that it may seek for its citizens.
Although Pakistan had told the ICJ that Jadhav's execution won't happen before August 2017, the ICJ did not only issue a specific order staying the execution till the proceedings before it are over, but also reminded Pakistan that it must be restrained in accordance with international obligations and global commitments to ensure free and fair justice to all.

Woman Donates Womb to Daughter in India's 1st Uterus Transplant
Pune: A team of doctors in the city on Thursday successfully performed India's first womb (uterus) transplant on a 21-year-old woman.
The woman, who was born without a uterus was fitted her mother's uterus so that she can conceive normally, reported PTI.
A team of 12 doctors, headed by Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, performed the surgery which started at 12 noon on Thursday and ended at 9.15 pm at Galaxy Care Laparoscopy Institute in the city.
"The patient was born without a uterus and she wanted to have her own baby and was not ready for adoption or surrogacy. Since they knew about the uterus transplant, they approached us and accepted the surgery option," Dr Shailesh Puntambekar said.
"Fortunately, her mother was found to be a medically suitable uterus donor for her," he added.
The younger woman is now under observation and will be kept in Intensive Care Unit for some days.
Dr Puntambekar said this was the first uterus or womb transplant in India.
The first successful uterine transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013. Twenty-five such surgeries have been performed around the world so far.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.
The separatists were receiving funds from chief of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) Hafiz Saeed to carry out subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley, including pelting stones at security forces, damaging public property and burning schools and other government establishments, the spokesman alleged.
The NIA has also taken cognizance of the news report related to the recording of conversations between a TV reporter and leaders of separatist groups operating in the Kashmir Valley in this regard, he said.

Blow-by-blow Account of How India Trumped Pakistan at World Court
New Delhi:  With the International Court of Justice staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav until the final verdict, India has emphatically won the first and the most important round of its legal battle against Pakistan at the global arena.
This, without a shred of doubt, is the most important reprieve at the moment since stalling Jadhav's execution was an imminent need. Without a stay on the execution, the entire purpose of invoking ICJ's jurisdiction would have been frustrated and the exercise would have been rendered an academic one to examine issues of jurisdiction, conventions etc.
Here are the five reasons outlined by News18 earlier in the day, predicting a propitious outcome, and how the ICJ ruled on these points:
Reason 1: India has been very meticulous and succinct in asking for a limited relief. What it prays for now is a stay on Jadhav's execution. If the stay is granted, not just that main relief will have to be adjudicated, but India will get time to look for a diplomatic and political solution.
ICJ ruling: India's claim for the limited relief at this juncture is justified on the principles of international law. The execution has to be stayed until we finally decide the matter on aspects of jurisdiction and applicability of Vienna Convention.
News18 was the first to tell you exactly why the balance was tilted in India’s favour in this battle.
Reason 2: India's counsel Harish Salve has aptly pre-empted Pakistan’s argument on the 2008 bilateral treaty between the two countries. While Pakistan contends India cannot be allowed to invoke Vienna Convention in the wake of the bilateral treaty, Salve has maintained that bilateral treaty cannot affect India's right to protect its citizens under the Vienna Convention. Salve was unequivocal that bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan is supposed to supplant other conventions in line with their common objectives and can’t frustrate the goals.
ICJ ruling: The 2008 treaty per se doesn't oust our jurisdiction nor was it a specific bar on India's right to ask for consular access from another country under the Vienna Convention.
Reason 3: Pakistan's argument that consular access is a matter of discretion for a law enforcement agency when the foreign national has been accused of spying has also been met by India. India has questioned various facts of the case, including how Jadhav was abducted from Iran, why India's repeated requests for consular access were shot down by Pakistan, trial was conducted without informing Jadhav and without supplying copy of the chargesheet or even the judgment. The moot point that India has appealed: Graver the charges, greater the need for continued adherence to the Vienna Convention, for it would involve life of people and relations between States.
ICJ ruling: India has been seeking consular access for Jadhav for almost a year, but to no avail. Pakistan said it would consider India's request only after Indian authorities help them in providing evidence to hold Jadhav guilty of espionage.
Reason 4: Pakistan has complained India is unwilling to explain the false passport, which bore a Muslim name and was found in Jadhav's possession. But if Pakistan wants India to explain this, then why not grant the consular access thereby accepting India's role in the adjudication process. Pakistan may just fall in a trap of its own, should the ICJ accept this argument.
ICJ ruling: Indian High Commission has time and again accepted Jadhav as an Indian national and has also given documents to the Pakistani counterpart in corroboration.
Reason 5: Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav’s legal remedies have not exhausted and hence there is no "urgency" to seek "Provisional Measures". But India has successfully demonstrated there is no stay on Jadhav’s execution and he could be executed any moment, necessitating the urgent intervention.
ICJ ruling: India has successfully established links between 'provisional measures' and India's rights to claim so. India has rightly invoked urgency clause and that irreparable prejudice to India's rights will be caused if Jadhav is executed.
International law is as good a law as countries consider it to be. It is, after all, a law without direct sanctions and Pakistan may even choose to defy the order since it's in favour of India. But it will do so at the peril of its international stature, obligation and future remedies that it may seek for its citizens.
Although Pakistan had told the ICJ that Jadhav's execution won't happen before August 2017, the ICJ did not only issue a specific order staying the execution till the proceedings before it are over, but also reminded Pakistan that it must be restrained in accordance with international obligations and global commitments to ensure free and fair justice to all.

Woman Donates Womb to Daughter in India's 1st Uterus Transplant
Pune: A team of doctors in the city on Thursday successfully performed India's first womb (uterus) transplant on a 21-year-old woman.
The woman, who was born without a uterus was fitted her mother's uterus so that she can conceive normally, reported PTI.
A team of 12 doctors, headed by Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, performed the surgery which started at 12 noon on Thursday and ended at 9.15 pm at Galaxy Care Laparoscopy Institute in the city.
"The patient was born without a uterus and she wanted to have her own baby and was not ready for adoption or surrogacy. Since they knew about the uterus transplant, they approached us and accepted the surgery option," Dr Shailesh Puntambekar said.
"Fortunately, her mother was found to be a medically suitable uterus donor for her," he added.
The younger woman is now under observation and will be kept in Intensive Care Unit for some days.
Dr Puntambekar said this was the first uterus or womb transplant in India.
The first successful uterine transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013. Twenty-five such surgeries have been performed around the world so far.

CBI Probes How Two Doctors Were Part of Rio Olympics Contingent
Subhajit Sengupta |  CNN-News18
 SubhajitSG
New Delhi: Two doctors—Pawandeep Singh and Col RS Negi—whose presence in the Indian contingent to Rio Olympics came under criticism are now under the CBI’s scanner.
Sources said CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry against the two doctors and have launched a probe as to how they managed to be part of the Rio contingent.
Col RS Negi and Pawandeep Singh are radiologists and not sports medicine doctors. Sources said Col Negi has never attended any national championship.
Pawandeep’s father is Tarlochan Singh, the powerful vice-president of Indian Olympic Association, while Negi is a relative and friend of IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta.
CBI sources said they will probe the allegations of nepotism and favouritism. The investigation would also look into how they got into the Olympic contingent and who in IOA cleared their appointment.

Introduction of Electoral Bonds a Retrograde Step, EC Tells Parliament Panel
New Delhi: The Election Commission on Friday told a Parliamentary Committee that electoral bonds introduced by the government is a "retrograde" step as it would compromise transparency in political funding.
The Commission, in a written submission to the parliamentary standing committee on Law and Personnel, said changes made in the election laws after the introduction of the bonds would compromise transparency in political fundings.
"The amendment in section 29 C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 making it no longer necessary to report details of donations received through electoral bonds is a retrograde step as transparency of political funding would be compromised as a result of the change," it said.
Senior Commission officials, including Deputy Election Commissioners Umesh Sinha and Vijay Dev, had appeared before the committee today to speak on EVMs, paper trail machines and electoral reforms.

Day After ICJ Stayed Jadhav's Execution, Pakistan Seeks Re-hearing: Reports
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav’s execution, Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the ICJ seeking a re-hearing in the case, Dunya News reported.
On Thursday, India scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ asking Pakistan to take “all measures” to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
Reading out the verdict, the ICJ court dismissed Pakistan's reservations and held that it had jurisdiction in the case because of Vienna Convention."Prima facie, a dispute exists under the Vienna Convention," held the court.
The court said it considered that Pakistan's failure to provide consular access to India was under the scope of Vienna Convention.
"Acts alleged by India fall in the Vienna Convention, which guarantees the state to be given access to its citizen," said the ICJ verdict.
In another blow to Pakistan, the court said that the circumstances in which Jadhav was arrested remained "disputed".

Kerala Assembly Passes Resolution Against GM Mustard
New Delhi: A resolution was passed in the Kerala Assembly on Friday demanding that the Centre withdraw permission for production and cultivation of Genetically Modified Mustard.
GM crops would be cultivated in the country if it was also approved by the Environment Ministry and 'it is a very serious issue', he was quoted as saying by PTI.
He demanded that the Centre not implement GEAC's decision as GM seeds would adversely affect farmers and the agriculture sector.
It would destroy traditional seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for their cultivation.
He said most states are also against GM crops.
Kumar said it has not yet been proved if GM crops would result in more yields, and claimed that it has been found that GM seeds attracts new insects.
Powerful pesticides would have to be used to safeguard crops from attacks of these insects, which in turn would harm human health, he pointed out.
GM trials were progressing in 75 varieties of crops and their target was to get approval for all crops one by one after getting sanction for GM mustard, he alleged.
"This move is dangerous to the country, farmers and also the agriculture sector", he said adding GM crops are against the interest of the people.
Congress led UDF Opposition leader supported the resolution and wanted a detailed discussion on the matter, to which the Minister said government would hold a debate in due course.

Inter-State High-Tech Sex Racket Busted in Bhopal, BJP Leader Arrested
Bhopal: The cyber cell of the Madhya Pradesh police have busted a sex racket and arrested nine people including a Bharatiya Janata Party office bearer here on Friday.
The police detected the racket in a flat in the posh Arera Colony of the city and freed four girls from Maharashtra and Meghalaya.
It came to light after the cyber unit of the state police received a complaint regarding a sex racket being run in Bhopal through a portal.
As the cyber cell probed into the complaint it was revealed that the portal supplied women through online booking. To avoid the police, the racket was being run from a flat in E-7 area in super posh Arera Colony.
Neeraj Shakya, who was recently appointed as SC Cell in BJP was also arrested by police in the case. Hours after the arrest, party state head Nandkumar Singh Chauhan expelled Shakya from the party.
Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, an officer from cyber cell said that the accused scanned various websites for finding CVs of women who were in need of job. Later, they would invite them to Bhopal on pretext of offering jobs such as beautician, receptionist and so on but then would force them to join flesh trade. The group was operating for the last three months.
The website is registered in New Delhi and has connection to other states as well. The police are now looking for the kingpin Subhash alias Veer Dwivedi who is absconding after the raid at his flat.

SC Declines to Stay Mandatory Aadhaar For Welfare Schemes
New Delhi: In a reprieve for the Central government, the Supreme Court on Friday refrained from staying various notifications issued under the Aadhaar Act to make unique identity number mandatory for several social welfare schemes.
A two-judge bench led by Justice A M Khanwilkar said that the court would not want to deal with the issue in piecemeal and would examine all applications against Aadhaar on June 27.
“It is appropriate if we hear all interlocutory applications together…they may involve same or similar issues,” said the bench while deferring the hearing of a plea made in a PIL filed by Shantha Sinha. Sinha is former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
Rohatgi, on his part, also made it clear that the government was not going to extend the deadline of June 30 by which various schemes such as grant of scholarships, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and various other social welfare schemes were to seek mandatory Aadhaar number.
“Today, we have 120 crore people who have Aadhaar cards but they are not here. The people who are supposed to be benefited by these schemes are not before the court but those who are not going to be affected by all, keep filing petitions after petitions,” rued the AG.
He complained that there was a similar PIL filed last year with same prayers but the apex court did not grant any interim relief. “Can they go on filing petitions after petitions which have even the same text? I can show that paragraphs in this petition are true copies of what was there in the last petition on the subject. This is abuse of the process of the court,” added Rohatgi, citing a petition moved by Lt Col (retd) S G Vombatkere in October 2016.
Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Sinha, replied that the previous petition might have similar prayers but the subject matter of the present PIL was entirely different. “These notifications were not issued when the previous petition was filed. We have come with fresh cause of actions. Besides, technicality should the last thing to be argued by the AG when we are claiming violation of fundamental rights. The court had in 2015 asked the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory and they are now in breach. The AG should not shy away from replying on merit,” said Divan.
“I am not shying away…I have fought these cases 20 times,” retorted Rohatgi, adding that Aadhaar was merely an executive scheme when the restraint orders were passed but now the Parliament has passed a law. “There cannot be any injunction against the Parliament from passing a law,” said the AG, adding that only a Constitution Bench should hear the matter.
The bench also reacted: “Mr Divan! Please don’t say that this court is not available for common citizens. This court is always available for them.” It then adjourned the matter to June 27, saying the court registry, after suitable instructions from the Chief Justice of India, will place this case before an appropriate bench.
Another bench in the top court had recently reserved its verdict on yet another challenge to linking Aadhaar with PAN cards and for filing Income-Tax returns. Newly inserted provisions in the Finance Act make it mandatory for people to have Aadhaar for validating their PAN cards and for I-T returns. The deadline to link Aadhaar for this purpose is June 30.

Martyr's Family on Indefinite Fast, Wants UP CM to Visit Village
Sambhal (UP): Family members of Sepoy Sudhesh Kumar, who was killed in firing by Pakistani troops along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir last year, today sat on an indefinite fast, demanding the chief minister Yogi Adityanath's visit to Pansukha Milak village.
Villagers and family members of Kumar, who laid down his life on October 16, 2016, sat on a fast in the village, claiming that despite promises by the BJP leaders, none of them visited the family again.
"We were promised sanction for a petrol pump, construction of a road and memorial in the village and renaming a village primary school in Sudesh's name by the BJP leaders, but none of the promises was met," Sudesh's brother Manoj Kumar said.
Another brother of the martyr, Anil Kumar, said they had lost trust in local BJP leaders and that was why they were demanding that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should visit them.
Sudesh's wife Kavita, mother Santosh Kumari, father Brahmpal Singh, Anil and a number of villagers began their indefinite fast.
The family had earlier too refused to perform the last rites till the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav visited them.
Brahmpal claimed, "The then chief minister had gone to a martyr's house in Etah as he was a Yadav. He should have come here too as there should not be any discrimination between martyrs."
Sudesh, hailing from Sambhal district, was killed whenPakistani Army fired on Indian Army posts along the Line of Control in Rajouri district.
As Akhilesh did not visit martyr's family, BJP leaders during assembly polls made it a political issue. BJP vice president Shiv Pratap Shukla, state general secretary Ashok Kataria and local MP Satpal Saini had also visited them and assured all help.

Sudesh's wife Kavita, mother Santosh Kumari, father Brahmpal Singh, Anil and a number of villagers began their indefinite fast.
The family had earlier too refused to perform the last rites till the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav visited them.
Brahmpal claimed, "The then chief minister had gone to a martyr's house in Etah as he was a Yadav. He should have come here too as there should not be any discrimination between martyrs."
Sudesh, hailing from Sambhal district, was killed whenPakistani Army fired on Indian Army posts along the Line of Control in Rajouri district.
As Akhilesh did not visit martyr's family, BJP leaders during assembly polls made it a political issue. BJP vice president Shiv Pratap Shukla, state general secretary Ashok Kataria and local MP Satpal Saini had also visited them and assured all help.
Martyr's Family on Indefinite Fast, Wants UP CM to Visit Village
Sambhal (UP): Family members of Sepoy Sudhesh Kumar, who was killed in firing by Pakistani troops along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir last year, today sat on an indefinite fast, demanding the chief minister Yogi Adityanath's visit to Pansukha Milak village.
Villagers and family members of Kumar, who laid down his life on October 16, 2016, sat on a fast in the village, claiming that despite promises by the BJP leaders, none of them visited the family again.

180 Dalit Families 'Convert' to Buddhism after Arrests of Bhim Army Activists

Lucknow: Around 180 families from Rupdi, Egri and Kapurpur villages of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh reportedly converted to Buddhism by immersing Hindu idols into a nearby canal.
“The police is intentionally harassing us. Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad is being targeted because he raised his voice against the atrocities inflicted by upper caste people on Dalits,” said Deepak, a resident of Kapurpur village.
So far, 10 FIRs have been registered against administrators of Facebook and WhatsApp accounts which were spreading rumours and inciting communal hatred in Saharanpur. The administrators named in the FIR mostly belong to the Bhim Army. Besides 10 cases registered under IT Act, Saharanpur police have lodged 14 other FIRs and have arrested 36 persons. In the past one week, 25 houses have been burnt down, 23 vehicles have been torched and several buses have been damaged.
An unregistered group and a movement as they call it, Bhim Army started as a social media phenomenon more than two years ago. In a short span of time, thousands of Dalits across the country started identifying themselves with this ‘aggressive’ and new kind of Ambedkarite politics. There are more than 40,000 Dalits who are members of this organization and it is spreading its wings outside Uttar Pradesh also.

Man's Suicide Bid Leads to Goa Bridge Collapse; Crocodiles Slow Down Rescue
Panaji: Search operations resumed on Friday at the site of a bridge collapse in south Goa with the Navy saying efforts were slowed down after locals spotted crocodiles in the Sanvordem river.
The dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem, a tributary of river Zuari, had been closed for traffic for the last four years. It collapsed on Thursday afternoon, unable to bear the weight of scores of onlookers watching a man trying to commit suicide. Fire and emergency services were at the spot, trying to save the suicidal man when the bridge collapsed.
Two persons had drowned while around 20 swam to safety. At least 14 people were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals.
"Crocodiles are seen by locals. Separate patrolling and lookout for crocodiles instituted. Chetak helicopters in search and rescue role... to search downstream. Terrain hilly and clouded," a Navy spokesperson said.
"As per local inputs, there may be two more persons missing. A helicopter sortie is being undertaken along the river for an aerial search," he said.
"The rescue operation began at 7.30 am today and efforts are on to check whether there are any more bodies in the water," Superintendent of Police (South) Shekhar Prabhudesai told PTI.
"The search operation was called off around midnight yesterday due to poor visibility. The divers from Indian Navy and a private agency which mans Goa's beaches have been pressed into service to search for the bodies," the SP said.

Did Hurriyat Leader Geelani Receive Lashkar Funds? NIA Launches Probe
New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others for alleged involvement in subversive activities and receiving funds from LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.
The others named in the PE are Naeem Khan, who was seen on television during a sting operation purportedly confessing to receiving money from Pakistan-based terror groups, Farooq Ahmed Dar alias 'Bitta Karate' and Gazi Javed Baba of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, an NIA spokesman told PTI.

Kejriwal Opposed Note Ban as it Threatened Money Laundering: Kapil Mishra
New Delhi: Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Friday claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had opposed the demonetisation move as it threatened to "derail" his "money laundering" attempts.
Mishra told a press conference that the AAP had got money funnelled through shell companies and wondered how it accepted donations from companies that were slapped notices "for not paying VAT".
"Why did he (Kejriwal) fiercely oppose demonetisation? Why did he travel across the country against the move? Because his men, who hoard black money, were being raided by enforcement agencies," he claimed.
Kapil, who has been suspended from the AAP, also alleged that Delhi-based businessman Mukesh Kumar, who claimed to have donated Rs 2 crore to AAP in 2014, was merely a mask for "proclaimed black money offenders".
"Ten days before AAP took office in 2013, Mukesh Kumar's company was slapped a notice by the Delhi government for not paying VAT. And then this person goes on to donate Rs 2 crore to AAP," he said.
He also questioned Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for not acting against Mukesh for defaulting on VAT after coming to power in 2013.
Kejrwal's first stint as Delhi CM ended within 49 days after he quit over the Congress and BJP allegedly blocking the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill.

New Delhi: Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Friday claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had opposed the demonetisation move as it threatened to "derail" his "money laundering" attempts.
Mishra told a press conference that the AAP had got money funnelled through shell companies and wondered how it accepted donations from companies that were slapped notices "for not paying VAT".
"Why did he (Kejriwal) fiercely oppose demonetisation? Why did he travel across the country against the move? Because his men, who hoard black money, were being raided by enforcement agencies," he claimed.
Kapil, who has been suspended from the AAP, also alleged that Delhi-based businessman Mukesh Kumar, who claimed to have donated Rs 2 crore to AAP in 2014, was merely a mask for "proclaimed black money offenders".
"Ten days before AAP took office in 2013, Mukesh Kumar's company was slapped a notice by the Delhi government for not paying VAT. And then this person goes on to donate Rs 2 crore to AAP," he said.
He also questioned Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for not acting against Mukesh for defaulting on VAT after coming to power in 2013.

'Our Lawyers Were Inexperienced', 'Our Case Weak': Pak Newspapers on ICJ Verdict
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) asked Pakistan to hold off executing Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Pakistani commentators were critical of the lawyers and their legal strategy in representing the country’s case at the World Court. Here is a roundup of opinion from the top Pakistani newspapers.
‘Our Lawyers were inexperienced’Former Attorney General Irfan Qadir told Dawn News that he was shocked by the decision. “The lawyers handling these matters had no experience. The arguments had no weight. They should have been presented in a rational manner,” he said. “We need a dedicated team for Pakistan, loyal to the country. Pakistan’s jurisprudence has been ruined because of this,” he said, adding that the country needed to be better prepared with an experienced legal team.
‘Our case was inherently weak despite our counsel’s brave attempts’Lahore-based lawyer and author Yasser Latif Hamdani wrote in The Daily Times that Pakistan’s case rested on the question of whether or not the ICJ had jurisdiction, which, in turn, was based on the proposition that the India-Pakistan bilateral agreement on consular access trumps the Vienna convention. “A bilateral treaty cannot override or curtail a multilateral international convention to which a state is party,” Hamdani writes.

However, one silver lining for Pakistan is India’s decision to invoke the jurisdiction of a multilateral body. “It ends the policy of bilateralism that has been the cornerstone of India’s Pakistan policy,” Hamdani writes.
‘Nawaz Sharif should explain the outcome of the ICJ proceedings’Pakistan-tehreek-e-insaaf leader Shafqat Mehmood demanded, in The News International that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should come clean on the ICJ proceedings.
The paper quoted him as asking why the government selected a lawyer, who didn’t have a single international law case reported from the UK Supreme Court and what was the reason to engage London Queen’s Counsel who was based in Qatar? He further pressed the PM to explain why his government assigned the task to a lawyer who has never argued a case independently before the ICJ and what compelled his government to send a first year associate from Attorney General’s Office instead of AG himself to the ICJ.

SP Government Spent Rs 15 Crore to Give Rs 20 Crore Unemployment Dole: CAG
Lucknow: The erstwhile SP government led by Akhilesh Yadav spent over Rs 15 crore on programmes to distribute unemployment doles worth over Rs 20 crore, according to a report by the country's top audit body.
The latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that this took place despite the flagship unemployment allowance scheme having specific guidelines that the money should be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The account details had to be provided by beneficiaries on their application forms for availing the scheme.
In its 235-page report on the general and social sector tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, now in session, the CAG pointed out that the expenditure could have been avoided if functions were not held to distribute the dole.
It stated that the state government launched the scheme in May 2012, saying that quarterly payment was to be made in the savings accounts of beneficiaries, either in a nationalised banks or in Kshetriya Gramin Bank.
Records of the director, training and employment, UP, revealed that the department distributed Rs 20.58 crore to 1,26,521 unemployed people as allowance by organising functions in 69 districts during the year 2012-13.
The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.

The report stated that Rs 6.99 crore was spent on the travel of beneficiaries to places where the functions were organised, while Rs 8.07 crore was spent on heads like seating arrangement and refreshments.
According to the report, the SP government spent Rs 8.07 crore on seating, refreshment and other arrangements for these functions in 2012-13, and Rs 6.99 crore on transporting beneficiaries to the venues.
These cheques were given to about 1.26 lakh unemployed persons and at many venues were handed over personally by Akhilesh, the then chief minister.
The state government, in its reply in September 2016, said the expenditure on the distribution of cheques was done as per instructions.
The state government had replied that though the opening of accounts in nationalised bank was mandatory as per the scheme's guidelines, it was not binding to make the payment to the beneficiaries through bank accounts.
The CAG, however, stated that the reply was not tenable as the provision of transportation of such large number of beneficiaries was not envisaged in the scheme guidelines.
The functions led to the spending of Rs 15.06 crore which could not be justified and showed a lack of financial propriety and concern for saving public money, the CAG report noted.
"An avoidable expenditure of Rs 15.06 crore was incurred on organising functions to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of Berozgari Bhatta Yojna in 69 districts though the unemployment allowance was to be credited to the beneficiaries' bank accounts," the CAG stated in the report.
The allowance scheme was initially started by the SP government of 2003-2007 under Mulayam Singh Yadav, with Rs 1,000 for each unemployed person within the age group of 30-40 years who had cleared high school.
The initiative was for residents of the state registered at the employment office and with an annual family income of less than Rs 36,000.
According to the CAG, the scheme was revived by the Akhilesh government in May 2012.
NGT Bans Open Defecation, Waste Dumping on Yamuna Floodplains
New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of Rs 5,000 for those who violated the diktat.
A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also constituted a committee headed by Delhi Jal Board CEO to oversee the execution of work pertaining to cleaning of the river and asked it to submit reports at regular intervals.
The Delhi government and the municipal corporations were directed to immediately take action against industries which operate in residential areas and are a major source of pollution to the river.
The green panel noted that almost 67 per cent of the pollution reaching the Yamuna would be treated by the two sewage treatment plants (STP) located at Delhi Gate and Najafgarh under Phase 1 of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.
The apex green panel had on May 1 ordered inspection of the STPs at Delhi Gate and Okhla with a view to ensure that wastewater was cleaned before it reached the Yamuna. It had sought a report with regard to functioning of these plants.
The tribunal was informed that a total of 14 STP projects are to be constructed to clean wastewater. Of these, seven are to be built by the Delhi Jal Board with its own funds.
The directions came as the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017'.

TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay Granted Bail in Rose Valley Chit Fund Scam
Cuttack: The Orissa High Court on Friday granted conditional bail to Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rose Valley Group chit fund scam.
The bench of Justice J P Das allowed the TMC leader to go on bail after depositing a sum of Rs 25 lakh in any nationalised bank and furnishing a bail bond of two sureties of Rs 50,000 each.
Among other conditions, the MP has been asked to submit his passport in the trial court and cooperate with the investigating officer, as and when required.
The bench had reserved the order on his bail plea after hearing arguments of both the prosecution and defence on May 8.
Bandyopadhyay had been arrested on January 3 by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the Rs 17,000 crore Rose Valley Chit fund case, which is being probed by the agency under the Supreme Court's directions.
Besides pleading that the senior politician from West Bengal was not involved in the scam, his counsel said that Bandyopadhyay was seriously ill and, therefore, needed to be granted bail.
The CBI has arrested another TMC MP, Tapas Pal, for his alleged involvement in the scam. The agency had earlier accused Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu and three others of defrauding investors from across the country of more than Rs 17,000 crore.

Class 12 CBSE Results: Students Anxious, But Hopeful of Low DU Cut-offs
New Delhi: While there has been no official declaration from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the Class 12 board results are expected to be declared this week. Like every year, students, this year too, are anxious about the fruits of their hard work, and what lies ahead. The only silver lining in between this panic and anxiety is the scrapping of the moderation policy.
"I’m sure everyone is anxious about the results, but with the CBSE scrapping the moderation policy, we’re at least sure that the university cutoffs will be realistic. Candidates, hopefully, will get a fair deal this time,” said Aayushi Bhardwaj, a student at Raja Ram Mohan Roy Public School who sat for the Class 12 boards.
Doing away with disparity in marking system of various education boards, Union Human Resources Development Ministry, last month, asked the boards to scrap the marks moderation policy, under which extra marks were awarded to students in certain papers that were considered to be difficult. This, in turn, is expected to bring down the high cut-offs for admission at prestigious colleges and universities.
In a meeting called by the HRD ministry, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), Indian School Certificate (ISC), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) and state boards unanimously agreed to do away with the marks moderation policy.
The move comes after CBSE, last year, had requested the HRD ministry to create consensus on phasing out of marks moderation policy, which inadvertently led to a spike in marks obtained by students of certain boards.
CBSE chairman R K Chaturvedi has reportedly asked Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to award “appropriate weightage” to CBSE students for admission to undergraduate program this year “so that they do not lose out to candidates from other state boards that inflate their Class XII results.”

Window Closes Today But Pak Refuses to Reveal If Jadhav Has Filed an Appeal
New Delhi: The 40-day period for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence handed to him by a Pakistani military court ends on Friday.
If the appellate court rejects the appeal, Jadhav can lodge a mercy petition (with the army chief) within 60 days of the decision, that is by July 18. If the mercy petition is denied on July 19, he may lodge a mercy petition with the President of Pakistan within 90 days — by October 16.

Jadhav’s case received a boost on Thursday when the ICJ sided with India and ordered Pakistan to stay the execution till proceedings were pending with the world court. It also upheld India’s right to consular access, a request Pakistan has denied as many as 16 times.
Also Read: Premature for India to Celebrate ICJ Order, Says Sarabjit Singh's Pakistani Lawyer
Pakistan, which announced the sentence on Jadhav on April 10, claims its security forces arrested him from its restive Balochistan province on March 3 last year after he reportedly entered from Iran. However, India maintains that he was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.
Jadhav's case is the latest flash-point in the tensions between Pakistan and India. The two countries last faced off at the ICJ 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.

Jadhav’s case received a boost on Thursday when the ICJ sided with India and ordered Pakistan to stay the execution till proceedings were pending with the world court. It also upheld India’s right to consular access, a request Pakistan has denied as many as 16 times.

Pakistan, which announced the sentence on Jadhav on April 10, claims its security forces arrested him from its restive Balochistan province on March 3 last year after he reportedly entered from Iran. However, India maintains that he was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.
Jadhav's case is the latest flash-point in the tensions between Pakistan and India. The two countries last faced off at the ICJ 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.

Premature for India to Celebrate ICJ Order: Sarabjit Singh's Pakistani Lawyer
Eram Agha |  News18.com

New Delhi:  Parallels have been drawn between the cases of Sarabjit Singh and Kulbhushan Jadhav, two Indians who were captured and charged with espionage in Pakistan. The latter’s execution has been stayed by International Court of Justice, but there concerns over his safety as Sarabjit was tortured and killed in a jail in Pakistan.
Sarabjit’s lawyer Awais Sheikh paid a heavy price for defending him in a Pakistani court. He was threatened and tortured. Ultimately, he had to leave Pakistan and seek asylum in Sweden. He now visits Pakistan only while helping the Stockholm Rotary Club in its drive against polio. Sheikh has been closely watching the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and tells News18’s Eram Agha that it will be premature to celebrate the ICJ order as there is a long road ahead for justice. Edited excerpts:
Are there similarities between the Kulbhushan Jadhav and Sarabjit Singh cases?
Although both were accused of spying and sentenced to death, Sarabjit’s case was different. He was tried and convicted by a civil court, whereas Kulbhushan Jadhav has been convicted by a military court. Sarabjit was tortured mercilessly. My book ‘Sarabjit Singh: A Case of Mistaken Identity’ has the story. In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, it has not been ascertained yet whether he was subjected to torture.

What does this case mean for the already strained India-Pak relations?
Kubhushan’s case has a direct bearing on India-Pakistan relations. The excellent and very timely move by India to go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has attracted the attention of the whole world. The world has come to know the sensitivity and importance of this case. Now, the order of the ICJ to put the execution on hold till the final decision in August has highlighted the importance of the matter and added to the strain in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The ICJ has stayed Jadhav’s death sentence for time being. Learning from Sarabjit episode, what should India do, going forward?In my opinion, India has won half the battle. There is no doubt that it is a legal, moral, psychological and diplomatic gain, but it will be immature to celebrate the order at this stage. It will be premature for India to celebrate. The task before India is to get Kulbhushan back home safe and secure. To achieve this, India needs to tread carefully and exhaust all possible means intelligently.

If you were to recommend India on a legal and political strategy to bring Kulbhushan Jadhav back safely, what would you suggest?
There is a long road ahead in winning justice for Kulbhushan. Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.

Through diplomatic and all other means, India should apply moral pressure on Pakistan from all quarters of the world and use all means to convince Pakistan that it would be in the best interest of peace and justice to set Kulbhushan free. It will, however, not be an easy task for the civilian government of Pakistan, which works under pressure and influence of the military, which passed this order. I think outside pressure on Pakistan can work.

How are things going to change for Pakistan politics after the stay on the death penalty?
It is yet to be seen how Pakistan reacts. I saw a discussion on the issue on a Pakistani channel. Senior journalist Rauf Klasra, to my surprise, spoke against the trial and death sentence. He was critical of the way this trial was conducted by the military court. He talked about consular access not being provided to Kulbhushan. I think India should try to gain favour from Pakistan’s legal fraternity, journalists and the general public. Due to the long confrontation between the two countries, it is not an easy task. I think one step India can take is freeing Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.

India accused Pakistan of violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Will this impact Pakistan’s reputation globally?
Yes, of course. The order of the ICJ was based on the strong reasoning that it violates fundamental rights. It will put Pakistan under moral and legal obligation to set Kulbhushan free. Pakistan cannot overlook or straight away refuse to comply with the order of ICJ. Otherwise, Pakistan will be totally isolated. It will adversely affect Pakistan’s reputation and international relations.

First Sarabjit and now Kulbhushan Jadhav. Is there a pattern in Pakistan’s actions?
This is because of the long confrontation between the two countries. Both countries have each other’s prisoners in captivity. And, unfortunately, they deal with such issues like business as usual. It has been so in the case of fishermen caught at sea. For both countries, the best way to settle their issues is through negotiation.

Sarabjit was tortured and killed in jail. How can India ensure the safety of Jadhav?
It is important that Kulbhushan is not tortured in jail. In the case of Sarabjit, I was fortunate enough to have access to him in jail. He was tortured. When I met him the first time, I saw his left leg badly infected. He was not well. With the passage of time, I used to help him, bring him medicines, fresh fruits and other edible items. He recovered and looked healthy later. I met him 25 times in jail with the permission of the court. In Kulbhushan's case, India, through diplomatic means, should try to convince Pakistan on consular access. Also, the relatives of Kulbhushan should be allowed to meet him.
How do you think India would have dealt with a Pakistani prisoner like this?
Unfortunately, both countries deal with each other’s prisoners as enemies. They are not treated as human beings. I cannot say India would be fair with Pakistani prisoners.
Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Pak Files Plea For Re-hearing at ICJ
Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking a re-hearing in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. India had scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ staying the execution of former Indian Navy officer Jadhav. The UN's highest judicial body also asked Pakistan to take "all measures" to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
India has hailed the verdict while Pakistan remains in denial over the ICJ’s jurisdiction.

RECAP | The Foreign Office spokesperson of Pakistan has reacted to the ICJ's order, staying the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav. "India has been trying to hide its real face" by taking the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav to ICJ. Pakistan will present solid evidence against Jadhav in the International Court,” the spokesperson said. The Pakistan foreign office also said that the International Court of Justice had no jurisdiction over the matters of national security. "India desperately tried to divert the world attention by portraying the entire case through a humanitarian angle," the statement said.

Karti Chidambaram Leaves for London, ED Books Him the Day After
New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday registered a money laundering case against Karti Chidambaram, adding to the troubles of former finance P Chidambaram’s son who is currently in the United Kingdom.
The probe agency registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), ED's equivalent of a police FIR, against the accused named in a CBI complaint, including Karti, INX media and its directors, Peter and Indrani Mukerjea. The ECIR has been registered under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Karti left for London on Thursday, two days after the CBI carried out searches at his home and offices across four cities for allegedly receiving money from the media firm owned by the Mukerjeas to scuttle a tax probe. Both Karti and his father said it was a “scheduled trip” and that he would return soon.
ALSO READ | 2 Days After CBI Raids at Home, Karti Chidambaram Leaves for London
The CBI had filed an FIR against Karti and the Mukerjeas on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, receiving illegal gratification, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.
It is alleged that Karti received money from INX Media for using his influence to manipulate a tax probe against it in a case of violation of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) conditions to receive investment from Mauritius.
These vouchers were issued in favour of Advantage Strategic Consulting (P) Limited, a firm "indirectly" owned by Karti, the CBI had alleged.
The senior Chidambaram, after the CBI searches on May 16, had issued a strong statement in response to the raids saying that the government was using the CBI and other agencies to target his son.
FIPB approval was granted in "hundreds of cases", the senior Congress leader had said.

Coal Scam Case: Ex-Coal Secretary Gupta, Two Others Convicted
New Delhi: A special court in Delhi on Friday convicted former coal secretary HC Gupta, former joint secretary KS Kropha and then director KC Samaria in a coal scam case.
The court will pronounce the order on quantum of sentence on May 22.
The court, however, acquitted chartered accountant Amit Goyal in the case.
Kropha was the then joint secretary in the Ministry of Coal, while Samria was the then director (coal allocation-I) in the ministry.
The CBI had charged that the firm had misrepresented its net worth and existing capacity, adding that state government had also not recommended the firm for the allocation of any coal block.
The accused, however, denied the allegations during the arguments.
Around eight different charge sheets have been filed against Gupta and proceedings are going on individually. The Supreme Court had recently dismissed his plea seeking joint trial in all these cases.(With PTI Inputs)

EC to Hold EVM Demo of Its Own, Decide on Hackathon Tomorrow

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP. The date of the hackathon — the poll panel’s open challenge to technocrats and political parties — is also likely to be announced on Saturday.
The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

New Delhi: The Election Commission will hold a demonstration on Saturday to counter the charge of EVM tampering levelled by a host of opposition parties, chiefly the AAP. The date of the hackathon — the poll panel’s open challenge to technocrats and political parties — is also likely to be announced on Saturday.
The poll panel’s demonstration comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to have successfully hacked into an EVM when its MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, gave a point-by-point demonstration on ways to rig the voting machine at a special session of the Delhi Assembly.

 SubhajitSG
New Delhi: Two doctors—Pawandeep Singh and Col RS Negi—whose presence in the Indian contingent to Rio Olympics came under criticism are now under the CBI’s scanner.
Sources said CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry against the two doctors and have launched a probe as to how they managed to be part of the Rio contingent.
Col RS Negi and Pawandeep Singh are radiologists and not sports medicine doctors. Sources said Col Negi has never attended any national championship.
Pawandeep’s father is Tarlochan Singh, the powerful vice-president of Indian Olympic Association, while Negi is a relative and friend of IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta.
CBI sources said they will probe the allegations of nepotism and favouritism. The investigation would also look into how they got into the Olympic contingent and who in IOA cleared their appointment.

Pawandeep’s father is Tarlochan Singh, the powerful vice-president of Indian Olympic Association, while Negi is a relative and friend of IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta.
CBI sources said they will probe the allegations of nepotism and favouritism. The investigation would also look into how they got into the Olympic contingent and who in IOA cleared their appointment.

Introduction of Electoral Bonds a Retrograde Step, EC Tells Parliament Panel
New Delhi: The Election Commission on Friday told a Parliamentary Committee that electoral bonds introduced by the government is a "retrograde" step as it would compromise transparency in political funding.
The Commission, in a written submission to the parliamentary standing committee on Law and Personnel, said changes made in the election laws after the introduction of the bonds would compromise transparency in political fundings.
"The amendment in section 29 C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 making it no longer necessary to report details of donations received through electoral bonds is a retrograde step as transparency of political funding would be compromised as a result of the change," it said.
Senior Commission officials, including Deputy Election Commissioners Umesh Sinha and Vijay Dev, had appeared before the committee today to speak on EVMs, paper trail machines and electoral reforms.

Day After ICJ Stayed Jadhav's Execution, Pakistan Seeks Re-hearing: Reports
New Delhi: A day after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav’s execution, Pakistan on Friday filed a fresh plea in the ICJ seeking a re-hearing in the case, Dunya News reported.
On Thursday, India scored a major diplomatic victory over Pakistan with the ICJ asking Pakistan to take “all measures” to ensure that Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged espionage, is not executed till the court delivers its final verdict on the issue.
Reading out the verdict, the ICJ court dismissed Pakistan's reservations and held that it had jurisdiction in the case because of Vienna Convention."Prima facie, a dispute exists under the Vienna Convention," held the court.
The court said it considered that Pakistan's failure to provide consular access to India was under the scope of Vienna Convention.
"Acts alleged by India fall in the Vienna Convention, which guarantees the state to be given access to its citizen," said the ICJ verdict.
In another blow to Pakistan, the court said that the circumstances in which Jadhav was arrested remained "disputed".

Kerala Assembly Passes Resolution Against GM Mustard
New Delhi: A resolution was passed in the Kerala Assembly on Friday demanding that the Centre withdraw permission for production and cultivation of Genetically Modified Mustard.
GM crops would be cultivated in the country if it was also approved by the Environment Ministry and 'it is a very serious issue', he was quoted as saying by PTI.
He demanded that the Centre not implement GEAC's decision as GM seeds would adversely affect farmers and the agriculture sector.
It would destroy traditional seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for their cultivation.
He said most states are also against GM crops.
Kumar said it has not yet been proved if GM crops would result in more yields, and claimed that it has been found that GM seeds attracts new insects.
Powerful pesticides would have to be used to safeguard crops from attacks of these insects, which in turn would harm human health, he pointed out.
GM trials were progressing in 75 varieties of crops and their target was to get approval for all crops one by one after getting sanction for GM mustard, he alleged.
"This move is dangerous to the country, farmers and also the agriculture sector", he said adding GM crops are against the interest of the people.
Congress led UDF Opposition leader supported the resolution and wanted a detailed discussion on the matter, to which the Minister said government would hold a debate in due course.
